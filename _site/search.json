    "text": "The ticket machine at Aswan train station was not working when we attempted to purchase tickets for the 4pm train to Luxor, these small things are typical in Egypt. We waited until fifteen minutes before departure before trying one last time. The man accepted $15USD cash for one, handing us two tickets to Luxor with unmarked seat numbers. Walking through the station multiple officials stopped us to inspect our tickets, cleaners followed ensuring we got to the correct platform then asked for a tip, a train worker took our bags stored them in the overhead space then held out his hand for a tip. I wish to be left alone sometimes, these faint but “necessary” tip-worthy acts are starting to piss me off…\nWe made it onto our train with minutes to spare, for a while I thought we would have to stay another night in Aswan. The train journey took three hours, we arrived around 7.30 in the evening and walked from the station to our hostel. Surprisingly, after leaving the immediate surroundings of the train station, we weren’t hassled by taxi or horse-drawn carriage drivers. Our room was private, as opposed to a dormitory, sometimes a few nights alone is nice. You meet fewer people but can sprawl out belongings, stretch in the mornings, play music, etc.\nWe stayed three nights in Luxor and did a few touristy things, they were:\n\nLuxor Temple\nJoined a tour which included:\n\nColossi of Memnon\nHatshepsut Temple\nValley of the Kings\nHabu Temple\n\nRide a hot air balloon\nKarnak Temple\n\n\nLuxor Temple\nOn our first day in Luxor, we chilled until early after afternoon, planning to meet a Mexican friend, whom we meet in the Aswan hostel, to visit Karnak Temple with. Following that up with an evening visit to Luxor Temple. Through a miscommunication (not helped by shoddy internet) we missed the opportunity to meet our Mexican friend, and because of this Karnak Temple took a back seat. Instead, we made our way to Luxor Temple which is the only temple in Egypt with opening hours that extend beyond 5pm.\nThe crowds at the Luxor Temple were insane. Just outside, hordes of locals had congregated to pray and mingle at a mosque, which probably happens every night. Inside, tourists were aplenty. The statues and columns were huge! Luxor Temple was originally built for King Ramses, but various other pharaohs including Roman leaders added and amended the temple with their own flavour. Outside the Temple, Sphinx statues line a path that originally ran all the way to Karnak Temple but now lasts just around a mile. In ancient times Pharaohs were carried on a float between the temples to mark some annual festival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTour\nOn our second day, we joined a tour booked through the hostel, this was the cheapest way to be transported between all the tourist sights that lie on the East Bank across the river.\nThe Colossi of Memnon was our first stop, long ago it was damaged by an earthquake cracking the lower half. Following its rupture, it was reputed to sing on various occasions most likely caused by wind moving through the cracks.\nHatshepsut Temple was extremely busy, she was a female pharaoh who lead for twenty-one years. A section within a mountain was cleared to make way for her temple, sitting nestled in the depression it is extremely beautiful. Ancient Egyptians described the surrounding mountain as arms that “hugged” the temple. One local man adjusted my headscarf “correcting” it and then asked for a tip. I walked away. Not long afterwards another man approached insisting my headscarf was tied wrongly, funny that!\nValley of the Kings is a valley in which, for nearly 500 years, rock-cut tombs were excavated for pharaohs and powerful nobles. I’ve forgotten whose tombs we visited, but they were beautiful. One in particular still retained its blue colouring.\nHabu Temple was the final stop. Only Trav & I entered this temple, everyone else from the tour was too tired. They missed out! The temple was lovely, with large steep walls it was really pretty.\nJoining the tour was a great way to meet other tourists. We got along with a few people and will most likely bump into them elsewhere along the tourist trail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollosi of Memnon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollosi of Memnon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple nestled in the mountain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValley of The Kings Tomb I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValley of The Kings Tomb I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValley of The Kings Tomb II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValley of The Kings Tomb II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValley of The Kings Tomb II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValley of The Kings Tomb III\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabu Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabu Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabu Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabu Temple\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloon\nThe one thing Dad pleaded with us not to do on this holiday was a ride in a hot air balloon. Naturally, this made it one of our must-do activities. A ride in Luxor was about an eighth of the price of one in Cappadocia, Turkey.\nOn our third day in Luxor, we woke at 5.30am and were transported to the take-off point across the river. Balloons dotted the sky making an extremely pretty morning vista. My camera was confiscated for the ride. National Egyptian jurisdiction forbids cameras from being taken into air space, but nowadays everyone takes photos with their phone so it didn’t make much sense. Trav was able to snap a few shots while we were airborne.\nWe met our balloon pilot, and funnily enough, one side of his face was burnt off, so I now understand Dad’s concern with Hot Air Balloon safety, in combination with the fact that balloons only have vertical control. Lateral movement is wist entirely upon unpredictable winds.\nIt was fun, and the views were great! For me, once is enough, I don’t think I’ll do another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\nAfter the Balloon, in the afternoon we visited Karnak Temple. Again, this temple was built for Ramses but was altered by various following Pharaohs. It is massive! The temple seemed to sprawl forever. The large columns were impressive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrap Up\nI enjoyed Luxor more than Aswan, I think this is because I wasn’t feeling sick. Also, I felt far less pressure from touts and drivers trying to scam me into emptying my pockets. Maybe I’m just getting better at dealing with them?\nAfter Luxor, we organised transportation to Dahab. This entails a ten-hour overnight GoBus to Cairo, with a two-hour layover, and finally a twelve-hour Minibus to Dahab. Which is like a full day of bus travel, yuck! But this is by the far the cheapest and best way for us to make it to the Sinai Coast. If the ferry was still operating between Hurghada & Dahab this would make travel to Sinai easy, but for some reason, it isn’t…it’s just one of those small typical things."

    "text": "Egypt\n\nCairo\nStarting off in Cairo, a lifelong dream has been to visit the monumental pyramid structures slightly north of the city. Next, the Egyptian Museum, which houses an impressive historical catalogue of artifacts, is a must. The minarets, domes, bazaars and alleyways which make up Islamic Cairo are slated to be the area for our first few nights of accommodation. I am looking forward to sitting in a tiny, quaint cafe sipping black syrupy coffee, smoking shisha, playing backgammon and talking shit with the locals. Witnessing the mesmerising and trance-like whirling ritual of the Dervish is also on the list of things to experience in Cairo.\n\n\nNile Valley\nTravelling south to Luxor, which is described as the world’s largest open-air museum. Luxor grew out of the ruins of Thebes, once the capital of ancient Egypt (1550 - 1069 BC). To foil thieves, and to little avail, Thebean Kings and Queens hid their tombs deep in the surrounding hills, away from the Karnak and Thebes temples. These valleys amongst the hills are known as The Valley of Kings and The Valley of Queens, around sixty tombs have been discovered (so far), including the tomb of Tutankhamun.\nContinuing south to Aswan, Egypt’s southernmost city. Aswan is known for its laid-back atmosphere and the most enchanting part of the Nile, where desert meets the water’s edge. It will be nice to travel here by Felucca (sailboat). From Aswan a day trip to Abu Simbel can be undertaken, Abu Simbel is a historic site comprising two massive rock-cut temples. In 1968 the temples were relocated to make way for a dam to be built across the Nile river, the relocation process itself is an engineering feat, manifesting an intersection between ancient and modern-day engineering.\n\n\nThe Western Desert\nThe oasis of Kharga, or any other oasis town/village, will be fascinating. The desert is virtually uninhabited except for five oases dotted around. To experience a feeling of isolation, see fantastic rock formations and dunes, and observe Egyptian life outside of the cities with mud-brick housing and traditional ways of life is the purpose of visiting Kharga. Hopefully, it will be possible to spend a night under the stars, uninterrupted by light and noise pollution.\n\n\nThe Delta & North Coast\nAlexandria is low on the list and might even be culled, annual flooding and plundering over centuries has ensured little remains testifying to the importance of the Delta in ancient Egyptian times. However, the port of Rosetta is where the famous Rosetta Stone was discovered, this stone enabled a system to be formulated for deciphering/translating hieroglyphics. The stone has been acquired by the Brits and sits within the Museum of London (not surprised).\n\n\nThe Red Sea Coast\nSham El-Sheikh, where the location of 2022’s Climate Change Conference (COP) was held, is known for coral reefs and scuba diving/snorkelling. Time here will be spent swimming/snorkelling in turquoise water and sighting marine life."

    "text": "Jordan\n\nGulf of Aqaba\nAqaba is the only coastal town in Jordan. Essentially, it will be our entry point into Jordan travelling here by boat. Doing so allows us to bypass Israel. A night or two here will allow us to plan Jordan in a bit more detail.\n\n\nArd as Sawwan Desert\nWadi Musa is the town closest to the Lost City of Petra. Exploring the ruins of Petra is a multi-day event and contains more than just the lost city, it beholds the Siq Corridor, The High Place of Sacrifice and a Monastery hidden high in the hills. I’m anticipating this to be one of the highlights of the trip.\n\n\nAmman\nAmman is the capital of Jordan. A day trip to the Dead Sea is planned, a cleansing float in the salt-rich water of the Dead Sea is something I’ve always wanted to do. We’ll also explore historic sites such as The Citadel and Roman Theatre. Being the capital, and a somewhat younger establishment than the rest of Jordan, Amman might be a city where Trav and I blow off some steam in the nightclubs of Arabia, which will be an experience in itself because Muslims don’t drink alcohol. - Maybe nightclubs and bars, as Westerners know them, don’t exist here?"

    "text": "Turkey\n\nSouth Coast\nFlying from Amman to Antalya is the cheapest option. Antalya is the biggest city in the south, I don’t think we’ll stay for long, and will organise transit to Bodrum quite quickly. It might be easiest to hire a car in Turkey?\n\n\nWest Coast\nJourneying across the South and up the West Coast, our first stop might be the small port town of Bodrum. Of course, Bodrum has historical components to it, however, the picturesque view overlooking the Mediterranean ocean is what drew our attention here. Bodrum will be a way to relax and ease into Turkey.\nFollowing Bodrum is Izmir. Again, we’re unsure why we chose Izmir. Our main purpose for travelling up the West Coast is to eventually make it to Gallipoli.\n\n\nNorth\nWe plan on being in Gallipoli for Anzac day. I remember being a kid at school and learning about the Anzacs, how they landed on the beaches of Gallipoli and were met with literal nightmares. Being there to commemorate the sacrifice young men and women undertook seems the right thing to do. Not that I condone war, the whole notion of it doesn’t make sense to me, particularly in these modern times.\nOur final destination in Turkey is Istanbul. What was once called Constantinople and occupied by the Romans, was the centre of the world for a long time. Merely holding this territory in the early 1000s, with its high impenetrable walls, ensured economic stability for it strategically straddled various trade routes. The Ottoman empire called Constantinople “the Red Apple” and took it over in the 1480s, which is when Christianity was replaced with the Muslim religion. The architecture and historical importance of Istanbul is what attracted us here."

    "text": "We arrived in Aswan around 11 am. Rest on the sleeper train between Cario and Aswan was surprisingly refreshing, there’s something about the rocking motion which puts you into a deep sleep. After settling into our hostel, we explored the city to get our bearings and decided to have a chill day putting off any sightseeing for later. Both of us had sea legs long into the afternoon as a result of the sleeper train. I could feel a slight tickle in my throat and thought I’ve caught the cold that knocked Trav out in Alexandria.\nThe next day I woke up ill and unable to get out of bed, I’ve definitely got what Trav had. So I slept all day and left Trav to explore. The activities we ended up doing in Aswan were:\n\nFelucca\nTombs of the Nobles / Hike\nAbu Simbel\n\n\nFelucca\nDuring my day in bed Trav met an Aussie (Darcy) and a Russian (Nikita) who were keen to stay on a felucca sail boat for an evening. Of course, we were keen as well so we joined them. We met the boat owner in the city and got a ride out to where the felucca was situated, 30mins out of the city. I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect, as in, how the felucca would be laid out, where we would sleep, etc… But, it’s literally like a big sailing mattress. Up the front is the sail, captain’s hull & toilet, in the middle is a massive flatbed mattress under shade, at the back is the rudder. A very simple layout for carting tourists up & down the Nile.\nBoy oh boy, this was like the ultimate chill experience. Standing on the felucca was awkward so we lay upon the big mattress and just meandered down the river, moving slowly with the wind. It was extremely relaxing and quiet, which is not often the case in Egypt. One of the felucca workers lit a huge hasish spliff and passed it around the boat, now this is the life.\nThat evening we moored at a grassy area with other boats. Workers from the cruise ships and sail-boats were playing soccer, which we joined in for a bit. Sleeping on the felucca wasn’t the best. Diesel generators from passing cruise ships were quite loud, mosquitos were relentless and the temperature was too hot at the beginning of the night, then too cold in the early morning. We all woke up tired.\nThe following day we sailed until Kom Ombo temple. The wind had dropped and we couldn’t go any further, or return. We ventured around the temple and returned to the felucca for lunch. We tried to get an understanding when we could return to Aswan city, but the felucca driver’s most knowledgable respose was “Inshallah” meaning “God willing”, so…sometime within the next week I guess. Obviously, us being spoilt Westerners, we needed more certainty about a return time, so we decided to take a train back to Aswan after lunch.\nOne night on a felucca was enough, I was looking forward to using my legs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca let the relaxation begin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca raise the sails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca water shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca water shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca downstream kids swimming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca water shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca water shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca luxury felucca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca mooring for the evening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca soccer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca donkey man\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca sunrise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca artsy shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca tree shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca Kom Ombo Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca Kom Ombo Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca Kom Ombo Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca Kom Ombo Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca goodbye crew\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\nFood poisoning\nThe day after returning from the felucca I was vomiting and had diarrhea from suspected food poisoning, maybe also from swimming in the Nile, although I never put my head under. Anyway, I was drained and spent a second full day in bed. This was a real shame because Trav and Nikita visited Abu Simbel.\n\n\n\nTombs of the Nobles / Hike\nThere is a walk on the west side of the Nile that has been beckoning us since we got here. In the morning Trav & I got the public ferry to the Tombs of the Nobles which we explored for a bit then walked through the desert for an hour or so to a small village, exploring monuments, such as the Dome of Abu Al-Hawa, along the way. The village is perched beneath the Aga Khan Mausoleum which is a beautiful structure but sadly has been shut for the last twenty-five years, not sure why.\nAt the village, DJs were setting up a stage and playing loud desert psytrance, some kind of celebration was happening. It started to kick off so we went over for a geez. A lot of young locals were gathered around the stage in a horseshoe shape, dancing, clapping hands and singing. The woman was making that “YeYeYeYeYe” desert sound. Fuck, this is nuts! We found out that the nursing students of Aswan have just graduated and this is their grad party.\nTrav and I joined in for a bit, dancing with locals to the beat of the drum, then we skipped off taking a rowboat to Elephantine Island. It was insanely hot so we went for a swim, afterwards making our way back to the hostel. That evening it was possible to hear the nursing students still celebrating across the Nile, most likely sober albeit.\nWhile in Aswan it would be sacrilege not to see Abu Simbel, so I booked minivan transportation leaving from the hostel at 4am the next morning. Abu Simbel is three hours away by car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs tomb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs pup with a view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs Trav powering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs golden sands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs donkey & camel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs nursing students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs nursing students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs nursing students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs nursing students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs nursing students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs nursing students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRowboat to Elephantine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRowboat to Elephantine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRowboat to Elephantine stop for phone call\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElephantine Island swimming spot\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbu Simbel\nAbu Simbel is the site of two massive rock-cut temples. They serve as monuments to King Ramesses II and his wife (1270 BC).\nI mustn’t be fully over my food poisoning, just before the minivan left at 4.30am I threw up my dinner from the night before. This is not a good way to start the day! Exhausted, I slept the whole way to Abu Simbel.\nThe monument is mind-blowing! Twenty-metre statues originally carved into the cliff face (but relocated due to rising waters from the dam construction in the 60s) stand towering over everything else in the area. It would have been a sight to behold in ancient times, and it still is.\nI was feeling like shit, so a fellow Aussie lass (Beth) gave me a super strong panadol which knocked me out.

The Nile views here are beautiful and we stayed in a really social hostel where we met lots of cool people. I found the constant push from touts in Aswan a bit insistent. Even walking in and out of the hostel, you’re swamped by children smashing you with the same questions “What’s your name?”, and “Where you from?” and then asking for money. It’s the same routine shop owners and taxi, horse & felucca drivers hit you with when walking the Corniche (Nile foreshore), although theirs has developed around an area of business.\nMaybe the constant in-your-face nature of Egypt is wearing me down? - I wonder if Luxor will be different?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNile view from hostel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop down shot from hostel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarcy (left), Mi Shoo (right)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunset from hostel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunset from hostel\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Visiting an Oasis was always part of our schedule, we hadn’t decided which Oasis to visit prior to arriving in Egypt and planned on organising it while in the thick of things. There are five Oases in Egypt, each one offering a unique set of desert sights & experience.\nAfter researching transportation for an evening, visiting an Oasis wasn’t as simple as we anticipated. There didn’t seem to be any (non-tour) buses that ventured from the Nile roads travelling inland towards the desert. We spoke to employees at our hostel about options getting to the desert and found out our hostel actually offered a tour to the Bahariya Oasis for $90USD per person. This price included transportation to Bahariya, a jeep journey through the Black & White Deserts, one night camping in the White Desert, food and water for the entire tour and transportation back to Cairo. This was a pretty good deal. It relaxed the requirement for us to organise further components beyond transportation and the price wasn’t ludicrous. So we snapped this up, and got ready for the mini-bus which left at 6.30am the following morning, packing a small day bag for the trip.\nThe mini-bus to Bahariya took around five hours, picking up tourists from other hostels & hotels along the way. Having other tourists on the tour was great because it gave us an opportunity to meet & talk to other people who came from all over the world. Joining us were Greeks, Chinese, Koreans, Turkish & Taiwanese.\nAfter arriving at the small village of Bawiti, we ate lunch and were split into two groups of six and assigned to a jeep driver who would chauffeur us around the Black & White Deserts. Our driver’s name was Hazim.\n\nBlack Desert\nThe Black Desert is an old volcanic area. Due to the volcanic activity, I was half expecting the sands to be black, much like the iron sands on Taranaki beaches. But the sand is not black, instead, mounds of black stone (not sure type of stone) push up through the sand forming small volcanoes everywhere, it looks like a scene straight out of Hades. The formations were quite beautiful and interesting. Driving fast through the desert in a trusty jeep, with Arabic music blasting really accentuated the feeling of adventure!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert Bahariya Oasis sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert interesting rock formation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert view from jeep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert on a dark desert highway...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert highway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert highway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert Trav & Hee (Korean)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert pit stop\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert\nLiterally across the highway from the Black Desert is the White Desert. The White Desert is whiter than the Black Desert is black. Here large limestone rocks are scattered everywhere, and we were weaving in between the rocks, driving down steep hills and drifting everywhere. I found views in the White Desert to be even more stunning and beautiful than the Black Desert. Hazim drove us to the top of a large sand dune and waxed up some sand-boards for us which we sat on and slid to the bottom of the dune. Trav & I asked about riding the boards standing up, but Hazim wasn’t keen on the idea because he has seen people injured in the past, and being injured in the desert with no medical assistance nearby is not a nice way to spend the evening. Trav actually attempted riding standing up, but the boards have no edge so carving down the slope wasn’t possible. Trav agreed that it was sketchy and a recipe for injury. After sand boarding we drove to a nice vantage point to watch the sunset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert limestone rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert jeeps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert roundish rocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert Trav\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert Me :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert swirling clouds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert big rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert view from jeep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert view from jeep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert sand boarding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert mushroom rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert white plains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert jeeps driving through round mounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert mound rock panoramic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert mountain vista\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert Hazem & jeep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert jeep derivers congregating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert chicken rock & sunset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert sunset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert view after sunset\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert - Overnight\nOnce the sun had set we drove to our camp where we would spend the night. The moon and stars early in the night were absolutely stunning, the Milky Way wasn’t visible yet. Hazim set up blankets for us to sit around around the fire and watch him prepare chicken, rice and pita bread for dinner. Dinner was delicious. By this time it was getting dark and the temperature dropped quickly. It was cold! Really cold! I was extremely glad to have packed a jacket. Not long after dinner Hazim set up a shisha pipe and we sat around the fire puffing shisha, just embracing the magical view of the Milky Way deep within the desert uninterrupted by light pollution and entombed within silence. This is a stark contrast to loud Cairo which we have been a part of for the last few days.\nWe opted to sleep under the stars instead of the tent, so we set up a thin mattress with sleeping bag and thick camel-fur blanket on the sand. The camel-fur blanket was an absolute necessity, it was insanely cold, and the blanket helped to establish a nice warm vacuum snug between the icy air and cool desert sand. With your head poking out the top a beanie would’ve achieved the comfort levels required to sleep, but I didn’t even bring one to Egypt, so Trav lent me a t-shirt which I wrapped around my head and went to sleep. I woke a few times in the night due to the cold and adjusted my camel-fur blanket to stave it off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert moon view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert fire moon view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert Hazim in main tent\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert - Sunrise\nWe woke at 6:30am to watch the sunrise.

On the way home (to Cairo), we all exchanged WhatsApp numbers and prepared to swap and send photos with each other when we get back into WiFi range.\nIf I had the opportunity to do a jeep desert tour again I would organise more than one night.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cairo was the first stop on this seven month endeavour. After landing, Trav & I negotiated a taxi from the airport to our accommodation for a reasonable price of £300EGP ($15NZD). The initial taxi ride was a shock to the senses, noises & sights were overwhelming. Car horns, in particular, dominate airwaves, and beeps and bops blend into one continuous stream of alerts. The architecture of buildings and infrastructure that whiz past the window is curved and majestic, very different and foreign to the squared, angled buildings in Australasia. In contrast, half-finished apartment blocks lie adjacent drenched in rubble and construction waste. We have only been in Egypt for 30 minutes so far…a slight fear of integration gripped my mind on the initial taxi ride.\nWe spent five incredible days in Cairo and our time was distributed across a few themes, they were:\nBefore delving into each theme, I would like to describe the general atmosphere. Cairo has a population of 20 million, it is an extremely busy place this is what adds to its wondrous nature! The traffic is crazy, and merely crossing the road is a challenge, something that takes time to grasp. Our first attempt at crossing the road took minutes, we were waiting for a gap in the traffic to allow safe passage across the street although the gap never came. Locals seem to just drip into the traffic like flour moving through a cake-sifter, somehow emerging safely on the other side. After a few days, we seemed to get the hang of it, although not at the same level of confidence as the locals. The trick is to spot a section of traffic with no motorcycles (they’re nimble and unpredictable), raise your hand, step onto the road, make eye contact with drivers and feign a resolute air. Under no circumstances should you hesitate, stride with the perceived confidence of a fashion model on the runway. The fastest, loudest and most dangerous runway you’ve ever walked.\nTouts and salesmen approach you consistently. We must have looked the brightest shade of green when we first arrived because we were pulled into gift stores so many times. They’re all full of junk nik-naks such as plastic pyramid figures, unauthentic papyrus paper & perfume and shisha pipes. Everyone who approaches you on the street is an artist willing to show you their life’s work, and sell for a “good” price. Tour guide salespeople working for a “government-run” tourist agency try to vie a way into your schedule by approaching with “Where you from? - NZ, ahh, Kia Ora! <Insert proceeding sales pitch…>”. We found it more pleasant to organise tours directly through the hostel or hotel. Another common scam we were stung by a few times is the water scam. Sometimes when ordering food or coffee, the server will place a bottle of water on your table. Being ignorant Westerners we assumed this water was gratis, on the house, however when paying, the bottle of water gets added to the tab at an insanely exorbitant price. Whenever an extra service is included in your order but not initially discussed it becomes an entrepreneurial way for a few extra bucks to be squeezed from tourists. Everything is an add-on in Egypt, we learnt to say “no, thank you” when something additional makes its way into service. We also learnt to just ignore and walk away from insistent touts pushing you to empty your pockets one way or another. It becomes easy to identify when someone approaches with the aim to scam you.\nScams aside, people are friendly, and welcoming and just want to talk. Only once we felt unwanted and unsafe which happened to be in a backstreet neighbourhood. In saying that, our most genuine experiences were also experienced in backstreet neighbourhoods, so it’s a dicey situation when venturing from the beaten path, mainly geared toward positive experiences."

A conscious display of project scope alteration in history’s finest. Brilliant! Because of this miscalculation another pyramid was constructed nearby, the Red Pyramid. I’m unsure why the original project wasn’t abandoned and resources salvaged to build the replacement pyramid.\nWe were able to enter the pyramids here, which was exciting! Clambering down the steep entranceways into the pyramids felt like we were discovering something for the first time. It was a special feeling. Deep inside the tombs it is hot and deprived of oxygen, a spiritual feeling nonetheless."

    "text": "Arriving back in Cairo from Bahariya our next destination planned was Aswan, Egypt’s southern most city. However, Trav & I counted up how many days remained on our visas and re-estimated how many nights to stay at destinations lined up (which was around 3/4 nights each), and it came out that we had about five days spare on our 30 day visas. Because of this, we changed tact a bit and decided to journey to Alexandria, Egypt’s second largest & northern most city situated on the Mediterranean coast. We had originally planned on skipping Alexandria all together. The following morning we went to the tourist intercity bus station (GoBus) and purchased tickets to Alexandria, leaving Cairo at 1.30pm, for £100EGP each ($5NZD).\nThe bus ride was scheduled to be three hours, but traffic leaving Cairo was nuts so it took more like five. That morning Trav had woken up not feeling healthy and sniffled the whole bus ride. We arrived in Alexandria and caught a taxi to our accommodation (Clement’s Hotel), on the way I realised I had accidentally left my mobile phone on the bus. I was listening to music resting it between my legs, when we arrived I stood up, walked off the bus, leaving my phone on the seat. FUCK! - That’s annoying. We had an early night sleep because we were still a bit tired from the desert and Trav wasn’t feeling well.\nThe following day Trav was not in a good state, he decided to spend the day resting in bed. I lined up a few sights for myself, they were:\n\nSidi Morsi Abu Al-Abbas Mosque\nThe Fish Market\nCitadel Qaitbey Fort\nCheck if my phone had been found at the Bus Station\n\n\nSidi Morsi Abu Al-Abbas Mosque\nThe mosque is huge and split into three different buildings all opening up into one courtyard. I’m unsure if that means the buildings are literally different mosques, or they all belong to one. Regardless, the architecture was beautiful. I arrived around midday the same time as the early afternoon call to prayer, which was special because the prayer halls were full, people were lined up in the courtyard with mats and prayers crackled loudly from the distorted speakers. It was an amazing sight to behold, and lasted for about fifteen minutes. I really wanted to snap a few photos but felt it would be disrespectful, so refrained from doing so.\nOne thing I realised moving on from this mosque is that, in general, streets surrounding mosques is where life happens. The mosques act as a congregation point for locals to buy & sell goods and negotiate trades & services. The street atmosphere after this particular call to prayer was really alive and fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque like the colour scheme on this building\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish Market\nAlexandria is on the coast and is built upon a culture of the ocean. An elderly gentlemen I had coffee with this morning (we spoke via sign-language), was a retired fisherman. His walking stick was an old fishing rod. So while here, I must check out and try the fresh fish. On Google Maps two Fish Markets could be pin-pointed, I made note to check them both out. After arriving at the first one, I realised it was actually a restaurant called “Fish Market”, now that’s a deceiving name. It looked like a flash joint, I highly doubt they charged market rates. A bit disappointing, although there is another one just up the road…or, so I thought.\nThe next fish market supposedly lined the entry to Qaitbay Fort. Sadly, this was just a normal market dotted with touts selling regular, uninteresting plastic trinkets. Bummer! Luckily after my time at Qaitbay Fort I stumbled across fresh fish being cooked and sold on the street. I bought a small red fish (no idea what kind) and two prawns, which were cooked in front of me. I was charged £160EGP for this! I’m unsure if this is the going rate for fresh food or I got totally ripped off, I think the latter. Regardless, the fresh fish & prawns cooked in spices was delicious!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish Market fresh seafood for sale, ready to be cooked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish Market fresh seafood for sale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish Market unsurprisingly, lots of cats here\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitadel Qaitbey Fort\nOn the peninsula a citadel call Qaitbay Fort was built in the 1470’s. Aside from the ocean & city views visible from the fort, there wasn’t much interesting about this place. I think I was a bit put off with all the scam artists hanging around. It was hard to have a moment of peace while being constantly bombarded by people asking if I want a photo (most probably from a stolen camera), or to buy something. Two young men followed me around the fort eventually approaching me to ask if they could hang out and practice English, I had absolutely zero trust in the fact that was what they actually wanted to do. I pretended to take a photo of something and walked away. I left Qaitbay Fort slightly agitated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort promenade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view over bay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view over bay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view within citadel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view from within\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view over bay into ocean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort Citadel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort Citadel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort Citadel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort obligatory cat photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort gardens at entry\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoBus Phone Reclamation Attempt\nI was a bit gutted having lost my phone, so I thought returning to the bus station to check if it had been handed in could be a good idea. I flagged down a taxi and tried to explain to the driver where I wanted to go. He understood the word “bus” and started driving in the complete wrong direction, eventually arriving back at Qaitbay Fort, pointing at buses and repeating the word “bus” on the way. This was going nowhere. I was already agitated from Qaitbay Fort so I just got out of the car and made my way back to the Hotel on foot.\nI managed to contact GoBus via WhatsApp on my laptop, they told me no lost property had been handed in from my bus trip. So it is now certain, my phone is gone. Luckily it was a cheap, cracked OPPO that I’ve already had for four years. Bloody annoying though!\n\n\nThe Next Day - My Birthday\nIt is my 32nd birthday today, what an awesome place to be on my birthday!

We spent nearly an hour at the station just trying to find the sleeper train ticket office. No-one could give us accurate directions, eventually we asked a pharmacist at the train station pharmacy (pro-tip Egyptian pharmacists speak really good English). We eventually found the ticket office. To our surprise purchasing one ticket required $80USD cash, Egyptian pounds and credit card were not accepted. What the actual flying fuck!? - Why would Egyptian pounds not be accepted in Egypt? So we decided to exchange some cash the following day and return in the morning.\n\n\nBirthday Beersies\nWe went out for beers that evening to celebrate my birthday. Drinking in Egypt feels like a sin, the bars (if they can be found) have tinted windows and are dark and seedy inside. We smashed back a few beers and got a burger on the way home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirthday Spitfire Bar closest thing to a Kiwi flag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirthday Spitfire Bar Vaporwave David\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAswan Sleeper Train - cont\nWe set aside a couple hours to sort this out, checking out of our hotel just in case it took a while. Boy-oh-boy, the saga continued! Our first stop was the bank to exchange cash, at the bank we were told no banks in Egypt exchange cash, the only place to do so is at street cash-exchanges. We then ventured to the financial area of town where banks and cash-exchanges are clustered. The first cash exchange only had $140USD, we required $160USD, so we took $100USD and went to the next exchange. There we were told foreigners can only buy foreign (non-Egyptian) currency if they present their plane ticket. We thought that was kinda weird. This was a reoccurring theme at every exchange we went to. They were either out of USD or wouldn’t sell to us because we couldn’t show a plane ticket.\nUnsuccessful, we felt defeated and went back to the hotel to reevaluate. Our next best option was to get a bus back to Cairo and attempt to purchase a sleeper train ticket from there. This part of the saga went quite smoothly. We swooped in on a GoBus with minutes to spare, arrived at Cairo train station and purchased a sleeper ticket using credit card and hung out at the station playing cards for a bit. Tomorrow we will wake up in Aswan to begin the next chapter of our travels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView from coffee shop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeshore Hotel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeshore Apartments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSheep & Rams outside mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc Monuments\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"

    "text": "Dahab is a really relaxed place on the Sinai Coast of the Red Sea with a beautiful mountain range to the north that makes for a picturesque back-drop. We arrived in the evening after a twenty-three hour bus journey, there were five or six police checkpoints between Cairo and Dahab which is why the trip ended up being so lengthy. I’m not sure why this area of Egypt is so heavily guarded. After walking to our hostel from the bus-stop we went straight to bed. Darcy, whom we met in Aswan, was in our (four person) dormitory.\nMost people we met here had stayed for weeks, even months, some actually lived there, usually for snorkeling, scuba-diving & free-diving. Life at the hostel felt like a small commune where everyone at together and organised things to do in the evenings. Locals in town are easy-going contrasting with the rest of Egypt’s in-your-face culture, Very few times sales-people approached or pressured us to purchase something.\nWe didn’t have anything concrete planned to do while here, the whole purpose was to relax and unwind. The four days we spent in Dahab, we played volleyball for two, swam at the beach, snorkeled at the Blue Hole Coral Reef and hiked with friends Mike & Anita (who we also met in Aswan).\nBecause Dahab wasn’t focused around attractions I found myself not carrying the camera as often, which meant I captured very few photos (too busy relaxing). Most of the photos in this post were taken either by Trav, Anita or someone else.\n\nVolleyball\nRafiki Hostel had a very active WhatsApp group (which is handy, although the notifications became overwhelming). On our first day a message was sent mentioning that beach volleyball will be played, both Trav & I played volleyball at school (indoor & beach), so we were excited to tag along.\nA beach volleyball court had been set up on the private beach of one of the resorts; locals, back-packers & expats who were keen on volleyball also got the message and showed up to play. It was really fun blowing off the cobwebs and playing volleyball again, I think I’ll take it up when I arrive back in NZ. It was funny watching the locals passionately discuss the rules in Arabic, often times the game would play-on/continue when no-one was really sure what was happening, even including the locals. This feeling of uncertainty is common throughout Egypt, although it interested me that the locals felt uncertain about things during the match…it makes me wonder if they also feel uncertainty about things that happen in the street (similar to foreigners).\nWe enjoyed volleyball so much that we spent a whole other day playing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolleyball\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolleyball\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Hole\nThe Blue Hole Coral Reef is probably the most popular dive & snorkeling spot in Dahab, it is suitable for both beginner & experienced divers and snorkeling on the water surface.\nTrav & I rented bikes from the hostel and biked in the heat for thirty minutes or so to get there. It felt nice being independent and cycling, I miss my bike back home in NZ. When we arrived we hired gear and snorkeled the reef, which drops abruptly ten metres or so out from the coast line. Fish of all colours could be seen, it was amazing to see such an abundance of marine life all centred around the coral. It makes one realise just how important coral is to the ocean eco-system.\nFor some reason wearing flippers gave me cramp in my toes, this always happens. So I was a bit uncomfortable out there in the ocean, especially because water was seeping in through my cheap goggles. I really don’t think I am cut-out for diving, honestly, I experience a feeling of claustrophobia when I’m stuck in a place with no exit, like underwater or the ocean depths for example. Perhaps this is an irrational fear, something I should attempt to overcome in the future?\nRegardless of me being a wimp, snorkeling the Blue Hole was awesome! We chilled out on the sunny balcony of a cafe afterwards, reading our books, then biked home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Hole\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike\nMike & Anita asked in the WhatsApp group if anyone was keen to join them on a hike to St Catherine’s Monastery, which is a monastery situated at the top of the highest peak in Sinai. Trav & I were keen so responded. After talking with the hostel about transportation we were hit with a price of $40USD which included transportation, permit into the national park & a guide. We thought this was a bit expensive for what was seemingly a simple hike, in typical Egyptian fashion simple things get blown out of proportion and become expensive as everyone tries to feed off the tourist-teat. So we researched hiking in the hills that could be seen from the hostel and found a suitable circuit.\nIt was a scorching hot morning when we left, I remember sweating balls in the dormitory. We caught a taxi to the foot-hills and started making our way upwards, surprisingly ground was covered quite quickly and within an hour or so we had already made it to the top ridge-line. The view from the top was incredible! The whole of Dahab could be seen, as well as distant mountains and Saudi Arabia was in full view. Rock formation was interesting in the sense that it was different to what is seen in NZ, whilst hiking it would’ve be nice to have a geologist explain how and why the rocks formed these ways.\nAfter walking the ridge line for a bit we made descent following a dried up river bed. This led us to a weir, used to stop the town from flooding during the rainy season. It appeared odd to prepare for something like this, the idea of heavy rains in this area seems so strange In saying that, it was forecasted to rain the following day so there was a chance we would witness it.\nIt was great getting out and doing a hike, strengthening our friendship with Mike & Anita along the way. They are following a very similar travel route to us so no doubt we will see them in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Greenery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Pinkery\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrap up\nDahab was lovely! I felt so relaxed here and would definitely return again, maybe to stay for a longer period of time. We checked out of the hostel in preparation for the 11am bus to Nuweibaa. By the time we arrived at the bus stop the rains had begun. Holy shit, the rains came down strong! The winds also picked up, it was like a desert storm as sand darkened the sky. Not far from the bus stop water was streaming off the mountain ranges creating rivers that flowed into the ocean, cars were driving through flooded roads. The weather turned around extremely quickly, from nice & warm to windy, wet and flooded. Luckily weirs at the bottom of the hills temp the flow of water.\nOur bus was three hours late. We took the bus to Nuweibaa so we could ferry to Jordan the following day. As we arrived in Nuweibaa my initial thoughts were that it is a shit-hole, and it was. It’s an industrial town with no tourists and everyone rips you off feigning a lack of English (which is probably true) charging insane prices for bottled water and taxis. The hostel we stayed at was disgusting! We were two of four or so people staying there. Human feces festered in every toilet, flies, mosquitoes and bed-bugs pestered us all night & the man running the show was so stoned he groaned instead of talked. Everything was a mess, although it had the potential to be an amazing place. I guess the town Nuweibaa just doesn’t have much going for it so tourists don’t really visit.\nWe only had £1500EGP left so we needed to ration what we had until arriving in Jordan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPizza Crew for Anita's birthday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPizza Crew for Anita's birthday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPizza Crew for Anita's birthday + Actor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch with Mike & Anita\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch with Mike & Anita\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch with Mike & Anita\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDusk over Dahab, Saudi Arabia on the horizon\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"
