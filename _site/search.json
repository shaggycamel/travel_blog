    "text": "Egypt\n\nCairo\nStarting off in Cairo, a lifelong dream has been to visit the monumental pyramid structures slightly north of the city. Next, the Egyptian Museum, which houses an impressive historical catalogue of artifacts, is a must. The minarets, domes, bazaars and alleyways which make up Islamic Cairo are slated to be the area for our first few nights of accommodation. I am looking forward to sitting in a tiny, quaint cafe sipping black syrupy coffee, smoking shisha, playing backgammon and talking shit with the locals. Witnessing the mesmerising and trance-like whirling ritual of the Dervish is also on the list of things to experience in Cairo.\n\n\nNile Valley\nTravelling south to Luxor, which is described as the world’s largest open-air museum. Luxor grew out of the ruins of Thebes, once the capital of ancient Egypt (1550 - 1069 BC). To foil thieves, and to little avail, Thebean Kings and Queens hid their tombs deep in the surrounding hills, away from the Karnak and Thebes temples. These valleys amongst the hills are known as The Valley of Kings and The Valley of Queens, around sixty tombs have been discovered (so far), including the tomb of Tutankhamun.\nContinuing south to Aswan, Egypt’s southernmost city. Aswan is known for its laid-back atmosphere and the most enchanting part of the Nile, where desert meets the water’s edge. It will be nice to travel here by Felucca (sailboat). From Aswan a day trip to Abu Simbel can be undertaken, Abu Simbel is a historic site comprising two massive rock-cut temples. In 1968 the temples were relocated to make way for a dam to be built across the Nile river, the relocation process itself is an engineering feat, manifesting an intersection between ancient and modern-day engineering.\n\n\nThe Western Desert\nThe oasis of Kharga, or any other oasis town/village, will be fascinating. The desert is virtually uninhabited except for five oases dotted around. To experience a feeling of isolation, see fantastic rock formations and dunes, and observe Egyptian life outside of the cities with mud-brick housing and traditional ways of life is the purpose of visiting Kharga. Hopefully, it will be possible to spend a night under the stars, uninterrupted by light and noise pollution.\n\n\nThe Delta & North Coast\nAlexandria is low on the list and might even be culled, annual flooding and plundering over centuries has ensured little remains testifying to the importance of the Delta in ancient Egyptian times. However, the port of Rosetta is where the famous Rosetta Stone was discovered, this stone enabled a system to be formulated for deciphering/translating hieroglyphics. The stone has been acquired by the Brits and sits within the Museum of London (not surprised).\n\n\nThe Red Sea Coast\nSham El-Sheikh, where the location of 2022’s Climate Change Conference (COP) was held, is known for coral reefs and scuba diving/snorkelling. Time here will be spent swimming/snorkelling in turquoise water and sighting marine life."

A night or two here will allow us to plan Jordan in a bit more detail.\n\n\nArd as Sawwan Desert\nWadi Musa is the town closest to the Lost City of Petra. Exploring the ruins of Petra is a multi-day event and contains more than just the lost city, it beholds the Siq Corridor, The High Place of Sacrifice and a Monastery hidden high in the hills. I’m anticipating this to be one of the highlights of the trip.\n\n\nAmman\nAmman is the capital of Jordan. A day trip to the Dead Sea is planned, a cleansing float in the salt-rich water of the Dead Sea is something I’ve always wanted to do. We’ll also explore historic sites such as The Citadel and Roman Theatre. Being the capital, and a somewhat younger establishment than the rest of Jordan, Amman might be a city where Trav and I blow off some steam in the nightclubs of Arabia, which will be an experience in itself because Muslims don’t drink alcohol. - Maybe nightclubs and bars, as Westerners know them, don’t exist here?"

    "text": "Turkey\n\nSouth Coast\nFlying from Amman to Antalya is the cheapest option. Antalya is the biggest city in the south, I don’t think we’ll stay for long, and will organise transit to Bodrum quite quickly. It might be easiest to hire a car in Turkey?\n\n\nWest Coast\nJourneying across the South and up the West Coast, our first stop might be the small port town of Bodrum. Of course, Bodrum has historical components to it, however, the picturesque view overlooking the Mediterranean ocean is what drew our attention here. Bodrum will be a way to relax and ease into Turkey.\nFollowing Bodrum is Izmir. Again, we’re unsure why we chose Izmir. Our main purpose for travelling up the West Coast is to eventually make it to Gallipoli.\n\n\nNorth\nWe plan on being in Gallipoli for Anzac day. I remember being a kid at school and learning about the Anzacs, how they landed on the beaches of Gallipoli and were met with literal nightmares. Being there to commemorate the sacrifice young men and women undertook seems the right thing to do. Not that I condone war, the whole notion of it doesn’t make sense to me, particularly in these modern times.\nOur final destination in Turkey is Istanbul. What was once called Constantinople and occupied by the Romans, was the centre of the world for a long time. Merely holding this territory in the early 1000s, with its high impenetrable walls, ensured economic stability for it strategically straddled various trade routes. The Ottoman empire called Constantinople “the Red Apple” and took it over in the 1480s, which is when Christianity was replaced with the Muslim religion. The architecture and historical importance of Istanbul is what attracted us here."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Visiting an Oasis was always part of our schedule, we hadn’t decided which Oasis to visit prior to arriving in Egypt and planned on organising it while in the thick of things. There are five Oases in Egypt, each one offering a unique set of desert sights & experience.\nAfter researching transportation for an evening, visiting an Oasis wasn’t as simple as we anticipated. There didn’t seem to be any (non-tour) buses that ventured from the Nile roads travelling inland towards the desert. We spoke to employees at our hostel about options getting to the desert and found out our hostel actually offered a tour to the Bahariya Oasis for $90USD per person. This price included transportation to Bahariya, a jeep journey through the Black & White Deserts, one night camping in the White Desert, food and water for the entire tour and transportation back to Cairo. This was a pretty good deal. It relaxed the requirement for us to organise further components beyond transportation and the price wasn’t ludicrous. So we snapped this up, and got ready for the mini-bus which left at 6.30am the following morning, packing a small day bag for the trip.\nThe mini-bus to Bahariya took around five hours, picking up tourists from other hostels & hotels along the way. Having other tourists on the tour was great because it gave us an opportunity to meet & talk to other people who came from all over the world. Joining us were Greeks, Chinese, Koreans, Turkish & Taiwanese.\nAfter arriving at the small village of Bawiti, we ate lunch and were split into two groups of six and assigned to a jeep driver who would chauffeur us around the Black & White Deserts. Our driver’s name was Hazim.\n\nBlack Desert\nThe Black Desert is an old volcanic area. Due to the volcanic activity, I was half expecting the sands to be black, much like the iron sands on Taranaki beaches. But the sand is not black, instead, mounds of black stone (not sure type of stone) push up through the sand forming small volcanoes everywhere, it looks like a scene straight out of Hades. The formations were quite beautiful and interesting. Driving fast through the desert in a trusty jeep, with Arabic music blasting really accentuated the feeling of adventure!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert Bahariya Oasis sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert interesting rock formation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert view from jeep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert on a dark desert highway...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert highway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert highway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert Trav & Hee (Korean)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert pit stop\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert\nLiterally across the highway from the Black Desert is the White Desert. The White Desert is whiter than the Black Desert is black. Here large limestone rocks are scattered everywhere, and we were weaving in between the rocks, driving down steep hills and drifting everywhere. I found views in the White Desert to be even more stunning and beautiful than the Black Desert. Hazim drove us to the top of a large sand dune and waxed up some sand-boards for us which we sat on and slid to the bottom of the dune. Trav & I asked about riding the boards standing up, but Hazim wasn’t keen on the idea because he has seen people injured in the past, and being injured in the desert with no medical assistance nearby is not a nice way to spend the evening. Trav actually attempted riding standing up, but the boards have no edge so carving down the slope wasn’t possible. Trav agreed that it was sketchy and a recipe for injury. After sand boarding we drove to a nice vantage point to watch the sunset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert limestone rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert jeeps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert roundish rocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert Trav\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert Me :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert swirling clouds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert big rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert view from jeep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert view from jeep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert sand boarding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert mushroom rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert white plains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert jeeps driving through round mounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert mound rock panoramic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert mountain vista\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert Hazem & jeep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert jeep derivers congregating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert chicken rock & sunset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert sunset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert view after sunset\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert - Overnight\nOnce the sun had set we drove to our camp where we would spend the night. The moon and stars early in the night were absolutely stunning, the Milky Way wasn’t visible yet. Hazim set up blankets for us to sit around around the fire and watch him prepare chicken, rice and pita bread for dinner. Dinner was delicious. By this time it was getting dark and the temperature dropped quickly. It was cold! Really cold! I was extremely glad to have packed a jacket. Not long after dinner Hazim set up a shisha pipe and we sat around the fire puffing shisha, just embracing the magical view of the Milky Way deep within the desert uninterrupted by light pollution and entombed within silence. This is a stark contrast to loud Cairo which we have been a part of for the last few days.\nWe opted to sleep under the stars instead of the tent, so we set up a thin mattress with sleeping bag and thick camel-fur blanket on the sand. The camel-fur blanket was an absolute necessity, it was insanely cold, and the blanket helped to establish a nice warm vacuum snug between the icy air and cool desert sand. With your head poking out the top a beanie would’ve achieved the comfort levels required to sleep, but I didn’t even bring one to Egypt, so Trav lent me a t-shirt which I wrapped around my head and went to sleep. I woke a few times in the night due to the cold and adjusted my camel-fur blanket to stave it off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert moon view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert fire moon view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert Hazim in main tent\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert - Sunrise\nWe woke at 6:30am to watch the sunrise. An orange hue slowly saturated the westward sky, and all of a sudden it appeared providing much needed warmth to everyone & everything.\nWe then had breakfast and set off in the jeep back to Bawiti.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert sunrise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert sunrise panoramic view\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTour End\nAt Bawiti village we met up with the other six on the tour, ate lunch and clambered into the mini-bus to head back to Cairo. By this time we had made new friends and got along with everyone on the tour really well. On the way home (to Cairo), we all exchanged WhatsApp numbers and prepared to swap and send photos with each other when we get back into WiFi range.\nIf I had the opportunity to do a jeep desert tour again I would organise more than one night. Two or three nights would be the prime amount of time to get a better understanding of the desert and the beautiful vistas it has to offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBahariya Oasis interesting house\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPit Stop view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPit Stop young boy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPit Stop donkey boy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPit Stop local boys having a chin wag\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"

    "text": "Cairo was the first stop on this seven month endeavour. After landing, Trav & I negotiated a taxi from the airport to our accommodation for a reasonable price of £300EGP ($15NZD). The initial taxi ride was a shock to the senses, noises & sights were overwhelming. Car horns, in particular, dominate airwaves, and beeps and bops blend into one continuous stream of alerts. The architecture of buildings and infrastructure that whiz past the window is curved and majestic, very different and foreign to the squared, angled buildings in Australasia. In contrast, half-finished apartment blocks lie adjacent drenched in rubble and construction waste. We have only been in Egypt for 30 minutes so far…a slight fear of integration gripped my mind on the initial taxi ride.\nWe spent five incredible days in Cairo and our time was distributed across a few themes, they were:\nBefore delving into each theme, I would like to describe the general atmosphere. Cairo has a population of 20 million, it is an extremely busy place this is what adds to its wondrous nature! The traffic is crazy, and merely crossing the road is a challenge, something that takes time to grasp. Our first attempt at crossing the road took minutes, we were waiting for a gap in the traffic to allow safe passage across the street although the gap never came. Locals seem to just drip into the traffic like flour moving through a cake-sifter, somehow emerging safely on the other side. After a few days, we seemed to get the hang of it, although not at the same level of confidence as the locals. The trick is to spot a section of traffic with no motorcycles (they’re nimble and unpredictable), raise your hand, step onto the road, make eye contact with drivers and feign a resolute air. Under no circumstances should you hesitate, stride with the perceived confidence of a fashion model on the runway. The fastest, loudest and most dangerous runway you’ve ever walked.\nTouts and salesmen approach you consistently. We must have looked the brightest shade of green when we first arrived because we were pulled into gift stores so many times. They’re all full of junk nik-naks such as plastic pyramid figures, unauthentic papyrus paper & perfume and shisha pipes. Everyone who approaches you on the street is an artist willing to show you their life’s work, and sell for a “good” price. Tour guide salespeople working for a “government-run” tourist agency try to vie a way into your schedule by approaching with “Where you from? - NZ, ahh, Kia Ora! <Insert proceeding sales pitch…>”. We found it more pleasant to organise tours directly through the hostel or hotel. Another common scam we were stung by a few times is the water scam. Sometimes when ordering food or coffee, the server will place a bottle of water on your table. Being ignorant Westerners we assumed this water was gratis, on the house, however when paying, the bottle of water gets added to the tab at an insanely exorbitant price. Whenever an extra service is included in your order but not initially discussed it becomes an entrepreneurial way for a few extra bucks to be squeezed from tourists. Everything is an add-on in Egypt, we learnt to say “no, thank you” when something additional makes its way into service. We also learnt to just ignore and walk away from insistent touts pushing you to empty your pockets one way or another. It becomes easy to identify when someone approaches with the aim to scam you.\nScams aside, people are friendly, and welcoming and just want to talk. Only once we felt unwanted and unsafe which happened to be in a backstreet neighbourhood. In saying that, our most genuine experiences were also experienced in backstreet neighbourhoods, so it’s a dicey situation when venturing from the beaten path, mainly geared toward positive experiences."

A conscious display of project scope alteration in history’s finest. Brilliant! Because of this miscalculation another pyramid was constructed nearby, the Red Pyramid. I’m unsure why the original project wasn’t abandoned and resources salvaged to build the replacement pyramid.\nWe were able to enter the pyramids here, which was exciting! Clambering down the steep entranceways into the pyramids felt like we were discovering something for the first time. It was a special feeling. Deep inside the tombs it is hot and deprived of oxygen, a spiritual feeling nonetheless."

However, Trav & I counted up how many days remained on our visas and re-estimated how many nights to stay at destinations lined up (which was around 3/4 nights each), and it came out that we had about five days spare on our 30 day visas. Because of this, we changed tact a bit and decided to journey to Alexandria, Egypt’s second largest & northern most city situated on the Mediterranean coast. We had originally planned on skipping Alexandria all together. The following morning we went to the tourist intercity bus station (GoBus) and purchased tickets to Alexandria, leaving Cairo at 1.30pm, for £100EGP each ($5NZD).\nThe bus ride was scheduled to be three hours, but traffic leaving Cairo was nuts so it took more like five. That morning Trav had woken up not feeling healthy and sniffled the whole bus ride. We arrived in Alexandria and caught a taxi to our accommodation (Clement’s Hotel), on the way I realised I had accidentally left my mobile phone on the bus. I was listening to music resting it between my legs, when we arrived I stood up, walked off the bus, leaving my phone on the seat. FUCK! - That’s annoying. We had an early night sleep because we were still a bit tired from the desert and Trav wasn’t feeling well.\nThe following day Trav was not in a good state, he decided to spend the day resting in bed. I lined up a few sights for myself, they were:\n\nSidi Morsi Abu Al-Abbas Mosque\nThe Fish Market\nCitadel Qaitbey Fort\nCheck if my phone had been found at the Bus Station\n\n\nSidi Morsi Abu Al-Abbas Mosque\nThe mosque is huge and split into three different buildings all opening up into one courtyard. I’m unsure if that means the buildings are literally different mosques, or they all belong to one. Regardless, the architecture was beautiful. I arrived around midday the same time as the early afternoon call to prayer, which was special because the prayer halls were full, people were lined up in the courtyard with mats and prayers crackled loudly from the distorted speakers. It was an amazing sight to behold, and lasted for about fifteen minutes. I really wanted to snap a few photos but felt it would be disrespectful, so refrained from doing so.\nOne thing I realised moving on from this mosque is that, in general, streets surrounding mosques is where life happens. The mosques act as a congregation point for locals to buy & sell goods and negotiate trades & services. The street atmosphere after this particular call to prayer was really alive and fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque like the colour scheme on this building\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish Market\nAlexandria is on the coast and is built upon a culture of the ocean. An elderly gentlemen I had coffee with this morning (we spoke via sign-language), was a retired fisherman. His walking stick was an old fishing rod. So while here, I must check out and try the fresh fish. On Google Maps two Fish Markets could be pin-pointed, I made note to check them both out. After arriving at the first one, I realised it was actually a restaurant called “Fish Market”, now that’s a deceiving name. It looked like a flash joint, I highly doubt they charged market rates. A bit disappointing, although there is another one just up the road…or, so I thought.\nThe next fish market supposedly lined the entry to Qaitbay Fort. Sadly, this was just a normal market dotted with touts selling regular, uninteresting plastic trinkets. Bummer! Luckily after my time at Qaitbay Fort I stumbled across fresh fish being cooked and sold on the street. I bought a small red fish (no idea what kind) and two prawns, which were cooked in front of me. I was charged £160EGP for this! I’m unsure if this is the going rate for fresh food or I got totally ripped off, I think the latter. Regardless, the fresh fish & prawns cooked in spices was delicious!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish Market fresh seafood for sale, ready to be cooked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish Market fresh seafood for sale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish Market unsurprisingly, lots of cats here\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitadel Qaitbey Fort\nOn the peninsula a citadel call Qaitbay Fort was built in the 1470’s. Aside from the ocean & city views visible from the fort, there wasn’t much interesting about this place. I think I was a bit put off with all the scam artists hanging around. It was hard to have a moment of peace while being constantly bombarded by people asking if I want a photo (most probably from a stolen camera), or to buy something. Two young men followed me around the fort eventually approaching me to ask if they could hang out and practice English, I had absolutely zero trust in the fact that was what they actually wanted to do. I pretended to take a photo of something and walked away. I left Qaitbay Fort slightly agitated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort promenade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view over bay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view over bay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view within citadel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view from within\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view over bay into ocean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort Citadel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort Citadel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort Citadel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort obligatory cat photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort gardens at entry\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoBus Phone Reclamation Attempt\nI was a bit gutted having lost my phone, so I thought returning to the bus station to check if it had been handed in could be a good idea. I flagged down a taxi and tried to explain to the driver where I wanted to go. He understood the word “bus” and started driving in the complete wrong direction, eventually arriving back at Qaitbay Fort, pointing at buses and repeating the word “bus” on the way. This was going nowhere. I was already agitated from Qaitbay Fort so I just got out of the car and made my way back to the Hotel on foot.\nI managed to contact GoBus via WhatsApp on my laptop, they told me no lost property had been handed in from my bus trip. So it is now certain, my phone is gone. Luckily it was a cheap, cracked OPPO that I’ve already had for four years. Bloody annoying though!\n\n\nThe Next Day - My Birthday\nIt is my 32nd birthday today, what an awesome place to be on my birthday! Trav is feeling slightly better so will join me in doing:\n\nThe Roman Theatre\nThe Catacombs\nBuying a train ticket to Aswan on the sleeper train\nBirthday Beersies\n\nBefore venturing out for the day we had a quick video call with Mum & Dad, it was great catching up with them.\n\n\nThe Roman Theatre\nThe Roman Theatre shows a slice of life in 200AD.

We spent nearly an hour at the station just trying to find the sleeper train ticket office. No-one could give us accurate directions, eventually we asked a pharmacist at the train station pharmacy (pro-tip Egyptian pharmacists speak really good English). We eventually found the ticket office. To our surprise purchasing one ticket required $80USD cash, Egyptian pounds and credit card were not accepted. What the actual flying fuck!? - Why would Egyptian pounds not be accepted in Egypt? So we decided to exchange some cash the following day and return in the morning.\n\n\nBirthday Beersies\nWe went out for beers that evening to celebrate my birthday. Drinking in Egypt feels like a sin, the bars (if they can be found) have tinted windows and are dark and seedy inside. We smashed back a few beers and got a burger on the way home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirthday Spitfire Bar closest thing to a Kiwi flag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirthday Spitfire Bar Vaporwave David\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAswan Sleeper Train - cont\nWe set aside a couple hours to sort this out, checking out of our hotel just in case it took a while. Boy-oh-boy, the saga continued! Our first stop was the bank to exchange cash, at the bank we were told no banks in Egypt exchange cash, the only place to do so is at street cash-exchanges. We then ventured to the financial area of town where banks and cash-exchanges are clustered. The first cash exchange only had $140USD, we required $160USD, so we took $100USD and went to the next exchange. There we were told foreigners can only buy foreign (non-Egyptian) currency if they present their plane ticket. We thought that was kinda weird. This was a reoccurring theme at every exchange we went to. They were either out of USD or wouldn’t sell to us because we couldn’t show a plane ticket.\nUnsuccessful, we felt defeated and went back to the hotel to reevaluate. Our next best option was to get a bus back to Cairo and attempt to purchase a sleeper train ticket from there. This part of the saga went quite smoothly. We swooped in on a GoBus with minutes to spare, arrived at Cairo train station and purchased a sleeper ticket using credit card and hung out at the station playing cards for a bit. Tomorrow we will wake up in Aswan to begin the next chapter of our travels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView from coffee shop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeshore Hotel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeshore Apartments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSheep & Rams outside mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc Monuments\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"
