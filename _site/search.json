    "section": "",
    "text": "Dahab is a really relaxed place on the Sinai Coast of the Red Sea with a beautiful mountain range to the north that makes for a picturesque backdrop. We arrived in the evening after a twenty-three-hour bus journey, there were five or six police checkpoints between Cairo and Dahab which is why the trip ended up being so lengthy. I’m not sure why this area of Egypt is so heavily guarded. After walking to our hostel from the bus-stop we went straight to bed. Darcy, whom we met in Aswan, was in our (four person) dormitory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost people we met here had stayed for weeks, even months, some actually lived there, usually for snorkelling, scuba-diving & free-diving. Life at the hostel felt like a small commune where everyone ate together and organised things to do in the evenings. Locals in town are easy-going, contrasting with the rest of Egypt’s in-your-face culture. Very few times sales-people approached or pressured us to purchase something.\nWe didn’t have anything concrete planned to do while here, the whole purpose was to relax and unwind. During the four days we spent in Dahab, we played volleyball for two, swam at the beach, snorkelled at the Blue Hole Coral Reef and hiked with friends Mike & Anita (who we also met in Aswan).\nBecause Dahab wasn’t focused on attractions, I did not carry the camera as often, which meant I captured very few photos (too busy relaxing). Most of the images in this post were taken by Trav, Anita or someone else.\n\nVolleyball\nRafiki Hostel had a very active WhatsApp group (which is handy, although the notifications became overwhelming). On our first day a message was sent mentioning that beach volleyball will be played, both Trav & I played volleyball at school (indoor & beach), so we were excited to tag along.\nA beach volleyball court had been set up on the private beach of one of the resorts; locals, back-packers & ex-pats who were keen on volleyball also got the message and showed up to play. It was really fun blowing off the cobwebs and playing volleyball again, I think I’ll take it up when I arrive back in NZ. It was funny watching the locals passionately discuss the rules in Arabic, often the game would play-on/continue when no-one was really sure what was happening, even including the locals. This feeling of uncertainty is common throughout Egypt, although it interested me that the locals felt uncertain about things during the match…it makes me wonder if they also feel uncertainty about things that happen in the street (similar to foreigners).\nWe enjoyed volleyball so much that we spent a whole other day playing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolleyball\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolleyball\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Hole\nThe Blue Hole Coral Reef is probably the most popular diving & snorkelling spot in Dahab, it is suitable for both beginner & experienced divers and snorkelling on the water’s surface.\nTrav & I rented bikes from the hostel and biked in the heat for thirty minutes or so to get there. It felt nice being independent and cycling, I miss my bike back home in NZ. When we arrived we hired gear and snorkelled the reef, which drops abruptly ten metres or so out from the coastline. Fish of all colours could be seen, it was amazing to see such an abundance of marine life all centred around the coral. It makes one realise just how important coral is to the ocean eco-system.\nFor some reason wearing flippers gave me cramp in my toes, this always happens. So I was a bit uncomfortable out there in the ocean, especially because the water was seeping in through my cheap goggles. I don’t think I am cut out for diving, honestly, I experience a feeling of claustrophobia when I’m stuck in a place with no exit, like underwater or the ocean depths for example. Perhaps this is an irrational fear, something I should attempt to overcome in the future?\nRegardless of me being a wimp, snorkelling the Blue Hole was awesome! We chilled out on the sunny balcony of a cafe afterwards, reading our books, then biked home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Hole\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike\nMike & Anita asked in the WhatsApp group if anyone was keen to join them on a hike to St Catherine’s Monastery, which is a monastery situated at the top of the highest peak in Sinai. Trav & I were keen so responded. After talking with the hostel about transportation we were hit with a price of $40USD which included transportation, a permit into the national park & a guide. We thought this was a bit expensive for what was seemingly a simple hike, in typical Egyptian fashion simple things get blown out of proportion and become expensive as everyone tries to feed off the tourist-teat. So we researched hiking in the hills that could be seen from the hostel and found a suitable circuit.\nIt was a scorching hot morning when we left, I remember sweating balls in the dormitory. We caught a taxi to the foot-hills and started making our way upwards, surprisingly ground was covered quite quickly and within an hour or so we had already made it to the top ridge-line. The view from the top was incredible! The whole of Dahab could be seen, as well as distant mountains and Saudi Arabia was in full view. Rock formation was interesting in the sense that it was different to what is seen in NZ, whilst hiking it would’ve be nice to have a geologist explain how and why the rocks formed these ways.\nAfter walking the ridge line for a bit we made a descent following a dried-up river bed. This led us to a weir, used to stop the town from flooding during the rainy season. It appeared odd to prepare for something like this, the idea of heavy rains in this area seems so strange. In saying that, it was forecast to rain the following day so there was a chance we would witness it.\nIt was great getting out and doing a hike, strengthening our friendship with Mike & Anita along the way. They are following a very similar travel route to us so no doubt we will see them in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Greenery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Pinkery\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrap up\nDahab was lovely! I felt so relaxed here and would definitely return, maybe to stay for a longer period. We checked out of the hostel in preparation for the 11am bus to Nuweibaa. By the time we arrived at the bus stop the rains had begun. Holy shit, the rains came down strong! The winds also picked up, it was like a desert storm as sand darkened the sky. Not far from the bus stop water was streaming off the mountain ranges creating rivers that flowed into the ocean, cars were driving through flooded roads. The weather turned around extremely quickly, from nice & warm to windy, wet and flooded. Luckily weirs at the bottom of the hills temp the flow of water.\nOur bus was three hours late. We took the bus to Nuweibaa so we could ferry to Jordan the following day. As we arrived in Nuweibaa my initial thoughts were that it is a shit-hole, and it was. It’s an industrial town with no tourists and everyone rips you off feigning a lack of English (which is probably true) charging insane prices for bottled water and taxis. The hostel we stayed at was disgusting! We were two of four or so people staying there. Human feces festered in every toilet, flies, mosquitoes and bed bugs pestered us all night & the man running the show was so stoned he groaned instead of talked. Everything was a mess, although it had the potential to be an amazing place. I guess the town Nuweibaa just doesn’t have much going for it so tourists don’t really visit.\nWe only had £1500EGP left so we needed to ration what we had until arriving in Jordan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPizza Crew for Anita's birthday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPizza Crew for Anita's birthday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPizza Crew for Anita's birthday + Actor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch with Mike & Anita\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch with Mike & Anita\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch with Mike & Anita\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDusk over Dahab, Saudi Arabia on the horizon\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"

    "text": "Our ferry crossing from Nuweibaa to Aqaba took a whole day, it wasn’t the journey itself that took a long time, it was the amount of security & passport checks and waiting around for who knows what. After leaving the hostel around 9am, we met Mike & Anita (M&A) at the ferry terminal and were sitting on the boat by 1pm. The boat didn’t depart from the dock until around 3.30pm. Trav & I were exhausted from a terrible sleep the night prior, complete with bed bugs, flies & mosquitoes, so we essentially slept the whole three-hour crossing. Jordan is an hour ahead of Egypt, so we arrived around 7.30pm local time, split a taxi to the city with M&A, said our farewells to each other (knowing we’ll probably meet again), and walked to our hostel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere in Aqaba is a stark contrast to Egypt. Instantly things feel more relaxed, touts aren’t as insistent and take “no” for an answer, accepting it, and walking away. The streets are cleaner, the air feels fresher and there is less hustle & bustle. Although, everything is more expensive, it is a similar price to goods & services in NZ. A feeling swept over me that we would enjoy our time in Jordan.\nAfter finding our hostel, the owner offered us a free dinner, eating with others at the hostel and cooked by a Palestinian guy who was volunteering there. A big platter of rice & chicken with tomato salad on the side was served. It was absolutely divine! Cardamon and other Arabic spices could be tasted, and best of all, it was, in fact, free, there was no bullshit hidden fees snaked in there.\nWe didn’t plan to see or visit anything in Aqaba, it was used as a point to recharge, do some washing, purchase some necessities (such as underwear) and organise our journey through Jordan.\n\nBeach\nAfter purchasing some small items, we spent the majority of the day at the public beach swimming & sunbathing, and reading our books. It’s a nice atmosphere there as local families relax under the awning shade, swim, listen to music, laugh and have fun. No one bothered us to buy cheap plastic crap or drugs, we relished the peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrap up\nAfter smoking shisha and eating falafel for two peaceful nights in Aqaba, we organised a trip to Wadi Rum, which is a nature reserve in the desert, through the hostel owner."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The ticket machine at Aswan train station was not working when we attempted to purchase tickets for the 4pm train to Luxor, these small things are typical in Egypt. We waited until fifteen minutes before departure before trying one last time. The man accepted $15USD cash for one, handing us two tickets to Luxor with unmarked seat numbers. Walking through the station multiple officials stopped us to inspect our tickets, cleaners followed ensuring we got to the correct platform then asked for a tip, a train worker took our bags stored them in the overhead space then held out his hand for a tip. I wish to be left alone sometimes, these faint but “necessary” tip-worthy acts are starting to piss me off…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe made it onto our train with minutes to spare, for a while I thought we would have to stay another night in Aswan. The train journey took three hours, we arrived around 7.30 in the evening and walked from the station to our hostel. Surprisingly, after leaving the immediate surroundings of the train station, we weren’t hassled by taxi or horse-drawn carriage drivers. Our room was private, as opposed to a dormitory, sometimes a few nights alone is nice. You meet fewer people but can sprawl out belongings, stretch in the mornings, play music, etc.\nWe stayed three nights in Luxor and did a few touristy things, they were:\n\nLuxor Temple\nJoined a tour which included:\n\nColossi of Memnon\nHatshepsut Temple\nValley of the Kings\nHabu Temple\n\nRide a hot air balloon\nKarnak Temple\n\n\nLuxor Temple\nOn our first day in Luxor, we chilled until early after afternoon, planning to meet a Mexican friend, whom we meet in the Aswan hostel, to visit Karnak Temple with. Following that up with an evening visit to Luxor Temple. Through a miscommunication (not helped by shoddy internet) we missed the opportunity to meet our Mexican friend, and because of this Karnak Temple took a back seat. Instead, we made our way to Luxor Temple which is the only temple in Egypt with opening hours that extend beyond 5pm.\nThe crowds at the Luxor Temple were insane. Just outside, hordes of locals had congregated to pray and mingle at a mosque, which probably happens every night. Inside, tourists were aplenty. The statues and columns were huge! Luxor Temple was originally built for King Ramses, but various other pharaohs including Roman leaders added and amended the temple with their own flavour. Outside the Temple, Sphinx statues line a path that originally ran all the way to Karnak Temple but now lasts just around a mile. In ancient times Pharaohs were carried on a float between the temples to mark some annual festival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxor Temple\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTour\nOn our second day, we joined a tour booked through the hostel, this was the cheapest way to be transported between all the tourist sights that lie on the East Bank across the river.\nThe Colossi of Memnon was our first stop, long ago it was damaged by an earthquake cracking the lower half. Following its rupture, it was reputed to sing on various occasions most likely caused by wind moving through the cracks.\nHatshepsut Temple was extremely busy, she was a female pharaoh who lead for twenty-one years. A section within a mountain was cleared to make way for her temple, sitting nestled in the depression it is extremely beautiful. Ancient Egyptians described the surrounding mountain as arms that “hugged” the temple. One local man adjusted my headscarf “correcting” it and then asked for a tip. I walked away. Not long afterwards another man approached insisting my headscarf was tied wrongly, funny that!\nValley of the Kings is a valley in which, for nearly 500 years, rock-cut tombs were excavated for pharaohs and powerful nobles. I’ve forgotten whose tombs we visited, but they were beautiful. One in particular still retained its blue colouring.\nHabu Temple was the final stop. Only Trav & I entered this temple, everyone else from the tour was too tired. They missed out! The temple was lovely, with large steep walls it was really pretty.\nJoining the tour was a great way to meet other tourists. We got along with a few people and will most likely bump into them elsewhere along the tourist trail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollosi of Memnon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollosi of Memnon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple nestled in the mountain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatshepsut Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValley of The Kings Tomb I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValley of The Kings Tomb I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValley of The Kings Tomb II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValley of The Kings Tomb II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValley of The Kings Tomb II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValley of The Kings Tomb III\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabu Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabu Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabu Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabu Temple\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloon\nThe one thing Dad pleaded with us not to do on this holiday was a ride in a hot air balloon. Naturally, this made it one of our must-do activities. A ride in Luxor was about an eighth of the price of one in Cappadocia, Turkey.\nOn our third day in Luxor, we woke at 5.30am and were transported to the take-off point across the river. Balloons dotted the sky making an extremely pretty morning vista. My camera was confiscated for the ride. National Egyptian jurisdiction forbids cameras from being taken into air space, but nowadays everyone takes photos with their phone so it didn’t make much sense. Trav was able to snap a few shots while we were airborne.\nWe met our balloon pilot, and funnily enough, one side of his face was burnt off, so I now understand Dad’s concern with Hot Air Balloon safety, in combination with the fact that balloons only have vertical control. Lateral movement is wist entirely upon unpredictable winds.\nIt was fun, and the views were great! For me, once is enough, I don’t think I’ll do another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\nAfter the Balloon, in the afternoon we visited Karnak Temple. Again, this temple was built for Ramses but was altered by various following Pharaohs. It is massive! The temple seemed to sprawl forever. The large columns were impressive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak Temple\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrap Up\nI enjoyed Luxor more than Aswan, I think this is because I wasn’t feeling sick. Also, I felt far less pressure from touts and drivers trying to scam me into emptying my pockets. Maybe I’m just getting better at dealing with them?\nAfter Luxor, we organised transportation to Dahab. This entails a ten-hour overnight GoBus to Cairo, with a two-hour layover, and finally a twelve-hour Minibus to Dahab. Which is like a full day of bus travel, yuck! But this is by the far the cheapest and best way for us to make it to the Sinai Coast. If the ferry was still operating between Hurghada & Dahab this would make travel to Sinai easy, but for some reason, it isn’t…it’s just one of those small typical things."

    "title": "Jordan - Wadi Rum",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We were excited about visiting Wadi Rum, we had both heard so much about it from other tourists and online blogs. The hostel owner organised camp accommodation (which is more like glamping) for 30JOD each and a mini-bus for us to the Wadi Rum junction for 5JOD each ($10NZD), where a camp worker picked us up in a ute and drove us into the desert. On the way, we drove past the Wadi Rum visitor’s centre, avoiding it altogether, which was a bit confusing. Going through the visitor’s centre, and paying an entrance fee is the only way into the nature reserve. Arriving at the camp Trav deduced from his map that the camp was not situated within the nature reserve, he became a bit frustrated, we were under the impression that we would be in the reserve. On top of that, lunch had been served and came with a 15JOD price tag (hefty). Again, we thought food and water were included. They were not.\nThis set Trav off, I could hear the frustration in his voice and sense it in his demeanour, I, on the other hand, was just happy to be out in the desert. It is usually me who gets wound up in these situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour\nA large group of middle-aged Welsh tourists arrived. They brought with them a real sense of fun! Lots of laughter and typical British banter lightened the mood. They got prepared for their Jeep tour, and we, assuming that we would be part of the same tour, got prepared also. Surprisingly, we were not organised to be riding in their jeeps. The confusion and ambiguous saga continues! In Arabia it feels like the mindset is so insular, convenience and efficient planning takes a back seat. Honestly, I think this is being driven by the culture of tipping. If more individual Jeep tours take place, more drivers receive a tip and essentially get “paid” for their work.\nOur driver arrived soon after the Welsh left and motioned that our tour would start in forty-five minutes, both Trav & I feigned ignorance pushing for the tour to start at the instant, it was already 3.30pm and the sun was going to set. This won him over and the tour began (a small victory!).\nAgain, Trav watched his map and noticed we moving in the opposite direction to the nature reserve. I could feel the heat from his blood, boiling. I tried not to laugh at his frustration and coaxed him to simmer down. Our first stop was at a little tea hut which was stationed outside ancient drawings of camel & emu(?) on the side of a cliff face. Supposedly these drawings are around three thousand years old. Inside the tea hut, we were offered tea (which I reassured was free) and were satisfied with some local Bedouin music played on a one-stringed instrument, with goat skin stretched over a square frame. It kind of sounded like a raspey violin. For me, this was the highlight of the tour, especially when he sang. By no means was the musicianship “good”, but the authenticity could be felt and the moment will forever be etched in my memory.\nThe rest of the tour we saw interesting rock formations, sifted through the desert on a rickety-ass jeep that broke down once and watched the sunset from a massive rock that we climbed. It was quite an adventure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour Welsh group getting ready\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour beginning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour ancient cave art\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour ancient cave art & Bedouin hut\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour Trav chilling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour Bedouin music\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour rock bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour trav rock bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour me other rock bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour me on top of other rock bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour me on top of other rock bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour Trav praise the lord\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour young boy and his camel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour rock shaped like Titanic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour sand drifties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour abandoned castle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour abandoned castle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour interesting rock formation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour sun setting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour sunset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeep Tour sunset\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlamping\nThat evening we sat around the fire with other tourists at the site. The Welsh were nice and offered us a beer/wine. Chicken & Lamb for dinner was cooked underground in a traditional Bedouin way. Food on this trip was expensive, so I made the most of it and piled my plate sky-high, eating as much as possible. The lamb was so juicy, delicious!\nWe wanted to go hiking the next day so tried to organise a tour with the supposed camp owner. He quoted us 70JOD each, which is incredibly expensive so we forwent the idea.\n\n\nRock Scrambling\nThe next morning we woke around 9am, smashed back a huge breakfast and went on our own adventure, without the assistance of some expensive guide. Just outside our camping spot, we scrambled up two massive rocks, rock climbing in some places. The view from the top was incredible. All up this took us about an hour and a half. We made our way back to the camp and quickly snatched a ride back to the junction where we planned to get transportation to Petra somehow. This part was completely unplanned, and we were prepared to hitchhike there if we had to. A local approached us and organised a taxi for us to Petra, he was an interesting dude, bit of a snake in my opinion, but asked us to volunteer at his Wadi Rum campsite, which sounded very appealing. We just don’t have enough time in Jordan for that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop of first rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrav scrambling up second (bigger) rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrav scrambling up second (bigger) rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrav scrambling up second (bigger) rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrav scrambling up second (bigger) rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop of second rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPanoramic view at top of second rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop of second rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrav's cairn at top of second rock\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrap up\nOur trip to Wadi Rum was a tad disappointing. Again, we were sold something that went against our expectations. This seems to often be the case when a tour is organised through a hostel, we’ve found it very hard to describe things to sales-people that go against the status quo, hence why we went through the hostel. In the future, we’ll probably try our hardest to overcome the language and price barriers of actual tour organisers to find ourselves in a situation that actually we desire to be in."

    "text": "We secured a taxi from the Wadi Rum visitors centre to Wadi Musa for 40JOD, showing up at a hostel with no booking, a capsule room (like Japan) with a double bed was available. We booked two nights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur main purpose in Wadi Musa was to visit the Lost City of Petra, the Jordan Pass (which is essentially a tourist visa into Jordan, purchased before entering the country) allowed us three days to visit Petra. We spent two days hiking through it and exploring.\nWadi Musa is at a high altitude, so it is much colder here compared to Aqaba & Wadi Rum. Something I found interesting is the touts here are purely for restaurants. Men stand on the street begging you to come into their restaurant and look at the menu, some even cross the road holding a menu and following you down the street. In no other place had we seen this, I’m unsure why touts that exist here are begrudged entirely to eateries. Regardless, we’ve become pretty good at ignoring them. One tactic I use is to respond with “salam alaykum” (meaning “hello”), to which they respond “alaikum salam”. For some reason, this throws them off and allows you to walk away unscathed.\n\nPetra Day One\nBrrr, it was a cold morning, we rugged up in thermal, jacket & scarf. It was forecast to rain on our second day in Petra, so we set aside the first day for a hike from Little Petra, past the Monastery, and finally to Petra which is about 14km.\nArriving at Little Petra by taxi (we later found out the shuttle bus is free 😑), we ventured through it stumbling upon a cafe overlooking a beautiful canyon landscape. Coffee here was a must! A couple cats came to hang out with us. Afterwards, the hike to the Monastery began. Few people were on the train, it wasn’t a challenging hike, mostly along a road where shuttle buses transport those incapable of hiking (lazy), a last one or two kilometre stretch of steps leads to the Monastery.\nWoah, breathtaking! The Monastery is stunning. It stands alone and is probably the most isolated of Petra’s buildings. A viewpoint is situated directly across from it, we ate lunch there.\nNow onwards to Petra. This part of the hike runs mainly through canyons which is really cool, a lot more people are on this part of the trail. Sadly, pop-up stores line the trail trying to sell junk jewellery and cheap Chinese crap, not once did I see someone purchase something. After a few hours, we arrived at the lost city and explored the Tombs of the Nobles, Roman Amphitheatre, High Place of Sacrifice and lastly the Treasury. The Treasury was my favourite, I can’t get over just how stunningly beautiful it is.\nAll up we hiked around 20km, it was a big day. I started to lose gas around 13km in, mainly because I hadn’t eaten a proper breakfast, but also due to my fitness not being the greatest struggling most on the way to the High Point of Sacrifice (the highest point in Petra). On the way home we stopped for fries and cola, a young man in the store was playing an Arabic instrument called “Oud”, I found this really fascinating. He asked if I wanted to play it, which I did poorly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Petra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Petra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Petra canyon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Petra scrambling cat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Petra Trav multi-tasking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra hike to Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra hike to Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra donkey on hike to Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra Jordan flag on hike to Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra stunning view on hike to Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra hike to Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra the Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra the Monastery plus donkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra the Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra the Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra hike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra Lions den, with Trav and cat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra donkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra goat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra Tombs of the Nobles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra a noble tomb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra Roman Amphitheatre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra hike to High Place of Sacrifice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra disobedient donkey on the way to High Place of Sacrifice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra obleisk at the High Place of Sacrifice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra view from the High Place of Sacrifice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra leaving the High Place of Sacrifice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra the Treasurey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra the Treasurey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanyon exit leaving Petra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra building on the exit\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetra Day Two\nIt was forecast to rain but we planned to see a few more things in Petra leaving in the morning to beat the rain.

Yesterday touts were offering to take us up the short way for 10JOD, but we didn’t want to pay for it so we took the long route.\nIt was maybe an hour hike, nothing tremendously challenging, but few people were on this trail. At the top we arrived at a cafe that obscures the Treasury view, one must enter the cafe and purchase a drink to see the view (sneaky). We needed a coffee so it worked out well anyway. Wow! The Treasury is my favourite building in Petra and the high view makes it even more impressive.\nAfter leaving the cafe we explored the outer-lying buildings where few others headed. It was nice having the place to ourselves.

    "text": "The road was shrouded in a thick fog all the way from Wadi Musa to Dana. The taxi driver drove extremely slowly and cautiously because the road could not be seen. Dana is a small village nestled in the mountains, livelihood in the village is either olive farming or tourism, which relies entirely upon the Dana Trail hike which Trav and I had planned. Steep cliff drops on the mountain road added to the cautious driving of our taxi-man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally we arrived in Dana around 5pm, after arriving he requested 40JOD, the original quote was 30JOD, given the dangerous state of driving we had no problem paying the extra 10JOD. Mist obscured the supposedly stunning valley view and a light rain refreshed and hydrated the skin’s pores. Our accommodation that Trav booked could not be found, our taxi driver asked someone, they mentioned the place had closed down, how strange. Why had their online advertisement not been removed? The man who provided the information actually worked at one of the two hotels in town, he took us in offering a slightly more expensive room to the one we originally booked.\nSheeeesh, it was cold in Dana! Much colder than Wadi Musa. That evening we ate dinner at the hotel and went to bed in the large, stone, cold bedroom. The next morning Trav found a cheaper hotel (the other one in the village) which was across the road. We checked out of our hotel, and moved across the road. This saved us 5JOD ($10NZD).\n\nHike\nThe hike was a 15km stretch ending in Feynan that required getting a three hour taxi back to Dana (expensive). Because of this, we decided to just hike half-way and turn around. We set out after moving into our new accommodation. It was still foggy, but was forecast to clear up throughout the day.\nThe beginning of the hike, which descended into the valley, was thick with mud. This was like walking with concrete shoes. By the time we descended the weather had cleared up and stunning valley views surrounded us, we followed the dried up river bed for three hours or so.\nWe stopped for lunch, sitting nearby some local Bedouins who were herding their goats to Feynan. Sitting next to a small fire, the Bedouin goat herders busted out a recorder and started playing. This was a magical moment! They called out to us, asking us to join them by the fire and shared tea with us.\nSitting with the Bedouins was interesting. Because one of them had a toothache, Trav gave them his panadol. They also asked for cigarettes and hash, we didn’t have hash but passed them a half-full cigarette packet. The packet wasn’t returned, instead it was pocketed. At first I was a bit confused by this, but later I thought; maybe they don’t see others for days at a time, so when they meet and share things they share large quantities, returning the favour at a future point in time.\nThe hike home was a bit of a slog, up a really steep valley hill. When we got to the top the stunning valley view, that couldn’t not be seen in the morning, was in full sight. Beautiful!\nWhen we got back to the hotel, the hot water wasn’t working (haha!). So we festered, un-showered for two days now. By midnight the hot water cylinder had been fixed, finally we could wash and warm up because it was fucking freezing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike foggy valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike bottom of the valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike valley rocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike bottom of the valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike cute Bedouin dog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike cute Bedouin dog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike cute Bedouin dog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Bedouin lunch spot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike shy Bedouin dog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike cute Bedouin dog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Bedouin lunch spot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike top of the valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike top of the valley Trav\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike top of the valley me\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrap up\nWe spent two freezing nights in Dana.

To feel a sense of adventure (and save money), we decided to hitch-hike there.\nFinal note: We found the building of our original hostel booking, it was in ruins (literally)."

    "text": "Egypt\n\nCairo\nStarting off in Cairo, a lifelong dream has been to visit the monumental pyramid structures slightly north of the city. Next, the Egyptian Museum, which houses an impressive historical catalogue of artifacts, is a must. The minarets, domes, bazaars and alleyways which make up Islamic Cairo are slated to be the area for our first few nights of accommodation. I am looking forward to sitting in a tiny, quaint cafe sipping black syrupy coffee, smoking shisha, playing backgammon and talking shit with the locals. Witnessing the mesmerising and trance-like whirling ritual of the Dervish is also on the list of things to experience in Cairo.\n\n\nNile Valley\nTravelling south to Luxor, which is described as the world’s largest open-air museum. Luxor grew out of the ruins of Thebes, once the capital of ancient Egypt (1550 - 1069 BC). To foil thieves, and to little avail, Thebean Kings and Queens hid their tombs deep in the surrounding hills, away from the Karnak and Thebes temples. These valleys amongst the hills are known as The Valley of Kings and The Valley of Queens, around sixty tombs have been discovered (so far), including the tomb of Tutankhamun.\nContinuing south to Aswan, Egypt’s southernmost city. Aswan is known for its laid-back atmosphere and the most enchanting part of the Nile, where desert meets the water’s edge. It will be nice to travel here by Felucca (sailboat). From Aswan a day trip to Abu Simbel can be undertaken, Abu Simbel is a historic site comprising two massive rock-cut temples. In 1968 the temples were relocated to make way for a dam to be built across the Nile river, the relocation process itself is an engineering feat, manifesting an intersection between ancient and modern-day engineering.\n\n\nThe Western Desert\nThe oasis of Kharga, or any other oasis town/village, will be fascinating. The desert is virtually uninhabited except for five oases dotted around. To experience a feeling of isolation, see fantastic rock formations and dunes, and observe Egyptian life outside of the cities with mud-brick housing and traditional ways of life is the purpose of visiting Kharga. Hopefully, it will be possible to spend a night under the stars, uninterrupted by light and noise pollution.\n\n\nThe Delta & North Coast\nAlexandria is low on the list and might even be culled, annual flooding and plundering over centuries has ensured little remains testifying to the importance of the Delta in ancient Egyptian times. However, the port of Rosetta is where the famous Rosetta Stone was discovered, this stone enabled a system to be formulated for deciphering/translating hieroglyphics. The stone has been acquired by the Brits and sits within the Museum of London (not surprised).\n\n\nThe Red Sea Coast\nSham El-Sheikh, where the location of 2022’s Climate Change Conference (COP) was held, is known for coral reefs and scuba diving/snorkelling. Time here will be spent swimming/snorkelling in turquoise water and sighting marine life."

A night or two here will allow us to plan Jordan in a bit more detail.\n\n\nArd as Sawwan Desert\nWadi Musa is the town closest to the Lost City of Petra. Exploring the ruins of Petra is a multi-day event and contains more than just the lost city, it beholds the Siq Corridor, The High Place of Sacrifice and a Monastery hidden high in the hills. I’m anticipating this to be one of the highlights of the trip.\n\n\nAmman\nAmman is the capital of Jordan. A day trip to the Dead Sea is planned, a cleansing float in the salt-rich water of the Dead Sea is something I’ve always wanted to do. We’ll also explore historic sites such as The Citadel and Roman Theatre. Being the capital, and a somewhat younger establishment than the rest of Jordan, Amman might be a city where Trav and I blow off some steam in the nightclubs of Arabia, which will be an experience in itself because Muslims don’t drink alcohol. - Maybe nightclubs and bars, as Westerners know them, don’t exist here?"

Antalya is the biggest city in the south, I don’t think we’ll stay for long, and will organise transit to Bodrum quite quickly. It might be easiest to hire a car in Turkey?\n\n\nWest Coast\nJourneying across the South and up the West Coast, our first stop might be the small port town of Bodrum. Of course, Bodrum has historical components to it, however, the picturesque view overlooking the Mediterranean ocean is what drew our attention here. Bodrum will be a way to relax and ease into Turkey.\nFollowing Bodrum is Izmir. Again, we’re unsure why we chose Izmir. Our main purpose for travelling up the West Coast is to eventually make it to Gallipoli.\n\n\nNorth\nWe plan on being in Gallipoli for Anzac day. I remember being a kid at school and learning about the Anzacs, how they landed on the beaches of Gallipoli and were met with literal nightmares. Being there to commemorate the sacrifice young men and women undertook seems the right thing to do. Not that I condone war, the whole notion of it doesn’t make sense to me, particularly in these modern times.\nOur final destination in Turkey is Istanbul. What was once called Constantinople and occupied by the Romans, was the centre of the world for a long time. Merely holding this territory in the early 1000s, with its high impenetrable walls, ensured economic stability for it strategically straddled various trade routes. The Ottoman empire called Constantinople “the Red Apple” and took it over in the 1480s, which is when Christianity was replaced with the Muslim religion. The architecture and historical importance of Istanbul is what attracted us here."

    "text": "Travelling by night bus is never fun, the upside of it is a night of accommodation and transportation are paid together. Slinking back to the hostel in Antalya in the early morning, we re-packed our backpacks and stocked up on a few supplies like vape juice and cash monies. It was no hassle catching a Kaş bus, they departed every forty-five minutes, and upon arriving at the bus terminal, we were instantly ushered onto the next awaiting bus - “Yalah, yalah, yalah” (let’s go).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI could feel a slight tickle in my throat and was weary that the long travel time and cold days in Capadoccia may have taken a toll on me. In Kaş, we stayed at a hostel that was a fifteen-minute bus ride to town. This was a slight inconvenience, but it was a cheap place and, aside from the location, was actually really nice.\nWe stayed two nights in Kaş, the main purpose here was to link up with Bara and prepare for the five-day Lycian Way hike. I wasn’t feeling well after dinner on the first night, so went to bed early.\nMan, I woke up crook! Super congested, sore throat, headache, achy muscles. It was a straight-up flu. I managed to get up for breakfast, meeting a few new people and gritting my teeth through a throbbing headache. Over breakfast, Bara mentioned taking five days off work (he’s a digital nomad) is just not possible right now, so he will not be joining us anymore. This was fine by us, honestly, it meant Trav & I can now charge through the trail without having to consider anyone else’s fitness level and mental well-being. Although, I was looking forward to spending time with Bara, hearing about Palestine and learning more Arabic. On top of this, the weather forecast for the next week looked terrible, with rain the whole time.\nAfter breakfast, I really wasn’t feeling well, so I went back to bed. Trav spent the day at the beach and in Kaş town with a couple Russian girls we ate breakfast with. By evening I was still feeling shite but was well enough to cook dinner with Trav and talk about the hike. Given the weather was about to cave in, we decided to begin the hike from Fethiye and hike five days south instead. That gives a bit of time for me and the weather to recover.\nI had a terrible sleep that night, barely resting at all. The next day I had to get out of bed and do something. So I joined Trav and Vera (one of the Russians) on a walk to the Beach and into town. It was a pleasant day, we picked and ate various different types of fruit from trees and sunbathed & swam (not me) at a couple beaches on our walk into town….ahhh, the tropical lifestyle.

I tested for covid, and it came back negative but I don’t think RAT tests work anyway. Have a feeling the cigarettes contributed to the flu. Our next destination was Fethiye, where we will prepare for the hike (it feels like there is always more to prepare). We missed the 1.30pm bus for Fethiye by two or so minutes but boarded the 2.45pm bus instead, they leave every hour and a bit.

    "text": "The bus ride from Dinizli to Göreme was a bit stressful. Trav actually booked the wrong date, so when boarding our ticket didn’t scan properly, he then realised the mistake and ran to the ticket office to sort it out. We made the bus with literal seconds to spare. Whilst on the bus, I was woken up by the host who asked me via sign language if I could put my shoes back on. It is bad manners to take shoes off when riding the bus in Turkey, and probably in most public situations too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bus snack food was stored directly above us in the overhead compartment. This was convenient because when hungry, in the middle of the night, I would stand, pretend to get something from my stowed jacket and pinch a handful of biscuits & muffins for us to eat. We arrived in Göreme around seven in the morning to snow on the ground 😮 - Shit, it was cold!\nTrav’s booking of incorrect dates extended to our accommodation, we walked to our hostel to try and book an immediate extra night. Upon arriving, an employee was sleeping on the couch. We entered but didn’t want to wake him, instead we connected to the internet and booked a night elsewhere. We trudged through the cold to our new hostel and rested on the couch, sipped coffee and waited for our dormitory beds to be ready.\nOn our travels, everyone we met said we must goto Cappadocia because “it’s amazing”, hence why we detoured from our route to visit. Our main purpose here was to view the sky dotted with hot air balloons and do some hiking. Sadly, during our three days in Cappadocia, the hot air balloons were cancelled each morning due to weather, something out of our control. So we never got to bare witness to what literally everyone described as “incredible”. However, we did some awesome hikes and a day of mountain biking which was fun!\n\nSunrise\nWe awoke at six in the morning to watch the sunrise from the viewing platform, an inner city viewing platform where the hot air balloons can be watched. Usually, it costs ₺10TL to enter, but Trav found a free entry point that is an extra 10-minute walk. Afterwards, we went returned to the hostel to sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunrise from viewing platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunrise from viewing platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunrise from viewing platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunrise from viewing platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunrise from viewing platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunrise from viewing platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunrise Turkey flag from viewing platform\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed Valley Hike\nAfter napping until 10am, we ventured outside, bought a Turkish coffee and literally wandered into the hills for a hike. Not really knowing where we were headed, the valley we ended up hiking in was called “The Red Valley”, this is due to the reddish hue seen in the rock formations. We didn’t follow a particular route and wound up in some dicey situations. One, in particular, where a steep drop bound us on both sides and we were tiptoeing along an extremely thin ridge of crumbly sandstone. We got out of there quickly and kept to the main path for the rest of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Red Valley morning shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Red Valley pigeons circling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Red Valley local Turk enjoying a coffee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Red Valley horseys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Red Valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Red Valley snow in the hills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Red Valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Red Valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Red Valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Red Valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Red Valley Çavuşin village\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Red Valley\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed Valley Mountain Bike\nThe next morning we vacated our interim hostel. The only good thing about our first hostel was the shower, it is amazing how certain vibes emanate from hostels. Some you gel with, and some you don’t. The new hostel had a good vibe.\nWe decided on renting bicycles to mountain bike through the valleys. Picking up two mediocre mountain bikes for ₺200TL for four hours, we set off into Love Valley. Trav’s bike was absolute shite! Chain slip occurred every time there was a gear change, mine was fine. Cycling through Love Valley was okay, but we were after proper mountain biking, so we set off for Red Valley to explore a different section than yesterday.\nThis was real mountain biking! We were so high up, wheeling along little goat/bike tracks trampled into the side of a hill. The view was incredible. We were moving too fast to make proper photography. The route we took looped the whole city, on one steep section I came off over the handlebars, luckily it was relatively flat and soft ground. Obviously, no helmets were supplied to us upon rental. By the end of the day, we were exhausted, it was only a twenty-kilometre cycle, but the hills really took it out of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBike Red Valley the setup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBike Red Valley one-eyed cat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBike Red Valley trail view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBike Red Valley trail view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBike Red Valley\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove Valley & Pigeon Valley Hike\nTwo red-headed English girls (sisters) ate breakfast with us on our last day in Göreme, their names were Megan and Bethany. All of us were eager to hike so we planned one together through Love Valley. It was easy, we nearly finished it within an hour, so we extended into Pigeon Valley. In Pigeon Valley we met a solo hiker from Switzerland, his name was Patrick. We formed a group, finishing the day together, eating dinner and, multiple times, purchasing beers from the bottle store and drinking them in inconspicuous public locations. We had to be stealthy about public drinking due to it being Ramazan and generally a Muslim country.\nIt was a really fun day! Megan project manages a music festival in England called “Smugglers” as her full-time occupation. It plays world and psychedelic music, an event I might check out in September which will probably be my last weekend of the trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Love Valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Love Valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Love Valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Love Valley farming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Love Valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Love Valley sisters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Love Valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike snowy mountain on horizon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Uçhisar Village\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Pigeon Valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Pigeon Valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Pigeon Valley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike Pigeon Valley\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrap Up\nThe reviews are accurate, Capadoccia is a beautiful place, although we never got to see the hot air balloons! This was a bit disappointing because it is the main reason people visit.\nCappadocia is an expensive place. It was very hard to find a meal (single) for less than ₺200TL, some Asian cuisine even ranged up to ₺800TL, insane! A single beer at a bar cost ₺120TL. To put that into perspective, a beer in Antalya cost ₺65TL, and Trav & I could eat a meal for around ₺150TL in total. It does make sense that Cappadocia is expensive. Riding in hot air balloons is a somewhat glamorous activity, and the rest of the town is accommodating to this facade. The English sisters mentioned Istanbull is similarly priced to Cappadocia 😳.\nIn the evening we boarded a night bus returning to Antalya to retrieve our backpacks. From Antalya, we bus to Kaş, where we will meet Bara and begin hiking the Lucian Way. Fifteen hours on a bus is never fun…"

    "text": "We set out with the plan to hitchhike from Dana to Amman. Standing on the main road, one hour walk up the hill from our Dana accommodation, the first vehicle to pick us up was the public mini-bus (haha!), which terminated at a Tafilah, halfway to Amman and cost 3JOD each (cheap).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile passing through a checkpoint, police pulled the driver and a passenger off the bus and heavily queried them about something. Quickly this turned into a shouting match and a small scuffle. This lasted for about fifteen minutes, the whole time Trav & I tried to sit inconspicuously in the back seat with our heads down hoping not to get dragged into it. At one point we considered taking our bags and getting out of the situation, it was kind of scary. Something switched up and our driver + passenger, who were fuming, just got back in the van and off we drove, onward from the checkpoint. This was a scary yet exciting experience, we had no idea what the argument was about, but I think the police were vying for a bribe which didn’t eventuate.\nAt Tafilah, our driver assisted us with finding a local bus to Amman. We boarded a large bus, paid 3JOD and were on our way. Damn, this whole experience was smooth and cheap. Everything just lined up, we arrived at our Amman hostel early and celebrated with a hot shower.\nThere were a few things we wanted to do while in Amman, they were:\n\nVisit the Citadel Ruins\nVisit the Roman Amphitheatre\nFloat in the Dead Sea\nMake a day trip to the town of Jerash, which has its own set of city ruins & a castle\n\nAfter day two we hired a car, which made transportation between sites and general organisation of the day much simpler and quicker. Driving in Amman is insane, streets in the city centre are lawless, car indication and sometimes traffic lights have no bearing, it is quite fun. On the highways outside of the city, driving is fine, drivers still carry out crazy maneuvers but there are fewer cars on the road so it’s manageable.\n\nCitadel Ruins\nOur hostel was next to the Citadel Ruins. The owner gave us walking directions which meant that we ended up jumping the fence to the compound and not paying for the site. Great! We’ll do anything to save a few bucks at this stage, Jordan is expensive. A panoramic view of Jordan from the top of the ruins is amazing, the largest flagpole in the world can be seen from the top. Sadly, no flag was flying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitadel mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitadel ruins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitadel inside mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitadel Hercules tower\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoman Amphitheatre\nWe walked from the Ruins to the Amphitheatre. We were hungry and tried to find a bakery for some bread, but it was actually the first day of Ramadan, so everything was closed! Eventually, we found a bakery and spread jam on pita bread in the streets for lunch. Everyone was looking at us, scowling. We felt really, really bad! Later, we discovered that eating in public during Ramadan is illegal, so we’re lucky no police saw us (although our western ignorance may have saved us).\nThe Amphitheatre is right in the city, it was a nice place to chill out. We sat at the top, smoked a cigarette and took in the relaxed atmosphere. By this stage, we’ve seen a few Roman Amphitheatres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoman Amphitheatre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoman Amphitheatre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoman Amphitheatre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoman Amphitheatre pidgeons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoman Amphitheatre\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Sea - day one\nThe Dead Sea was so enjoyable that we went twice.\nWe met a Scottish guy in the hostel (Nathan) and organised a day trip to the Dead Sea with him, but first, we had to obtain a rental car. In the morning, we took an Uber to Thrifty car rentals and drove back to the hostel with a Nissan Sunny, it cost 25JOD a day and was much easier to organise the rental in person as opposed to online.\nTrav was braver than I driving the vehicle, so he manned the wheel on the first day. It was a couple hours drive to the Dead Sea. We stopped at Salt Beach and walked over a thick crust of salt to get to the water. Walking barefoot on the salt hurts quite a bit, it’s really sharp. Wading into the water it feels very viscous, kind of like tuna brine in a can. And, all of a sudden, you just float! It’s like sunbathing on the surface of the water, such an incredible feeling. A few drops of water made it into my mouth, the taste was disgusting. I’m glad my head stayed above water. A large bottle of fresh water came in handy to wash the thick slimy salt off afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Sea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Sea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Sea salted rocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Sea a crusty salty coast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Sea Trav & I taking the plunge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Sea Trav & I floating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Sea Trav & Nathan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Sea\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJerash\nHitomi, a friend whom we met in Aswan, appeared at our hostel one evening. We spoke over breakfast and she was keen to join us & Nathan for the day trip to Jerash. Jerash was a two-hour drive from Amman.

Although, a Portugese guy named Bruno, who hitchhikes around the world full time, was keen to join us on our second trip to the Dead Sea. We filled up the car with Trav & me, Hitomi and Bruno and drove the familiar roads out to our favourite beach spot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Sea Trav\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Sea Bruno & Hitomi\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrap up\nWe stayed in Amman for a week and really enjoyed the city. Honestly, I could live there. People are friendly, the city is interesting, and there is a lot of history and culture. Ramadan really threw a spanner in the works for us, it makes getting food & drink quite difficult. City streets are quiet during the day, and very few people are out and about, although at night, the streets become alive, and a buzz can be felt in the air until early morning. Even young children are running around, rejoicing in the Ramadan street atmosphere with friends.\nIt was great travelling with friends on this leg of the journey, meeting Nathan, Hitomi & Bruno was awesome, and driving a car in a third-world country was an experience. Somehow, without road rules, things still seem to work. In fact, I think the traffic flowed more efficiently without road rules than with them. There are so many factors to consider with this, abolishing road rules in Western society would not placate well with the regimented way our brains operate. Although, with the loose and funky way third-world country locals manifest thoughts, the lack of road rules seems to work.\nAmman is our last stop in Jordan, I really liked the laid-back nature and small feeling of Jordan. If only it was cheaper I would have spent more time there. To begin the next leg of our journey, we booked the cheapest flight to our next stop (Antalya, Turkey), which departs at three in the morning (uhhhh…).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCool grafitti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFresh tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisty view of dead sea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChurch on top of Mount Nebo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive by camel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive by camels\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"

    "text": "We arrived in Aswan around 11 am. Rest on the sleeper train between Cario and Aswan was surprisingly refreshing, there’s something about the rocking motion which puts you into a deep sleep. After settling into our hostel, we explored the city to get our bearings and decided to have a chill day putting off any sightseeing for later. Both of us had sea legs long into the afternoon as a result of the sleeper train. I could feel a slight tickle in my throat and thought I’ve caught the cold that knocked Trav out in Alexandria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day I woke up ill and unable to get out of bed, I’ve definitely got what Trav had. So I slept all day and left Trav to explore. The activities we ended up doing in Aswan were:\n\nFelucca\nTombs of the Nobles / Hike\nAbu Simbel\n\n\nFelucca\nDuring my day in bed Trav met an Aussie (Darcy) and a Russian (Nikita) who were keen to stay on a felucca sail boat for an evening. Of course, we were keen as well so we joined them. We met the boat owner in the city and got a ride out to where the felucca was situated, 30mins out of the city. I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect, as in, how the felucca would be laid out, where we would sleep, etc… But, it’s literally like a big sailing mattress. Up the front is the sail, captain’s hull & toilet, in the middle is a massive flatbed mattress under shade, at the back is the rudder. A very simple layout for carting tourists up & down the Nile.\nBoy oh boy, this was like the ultimate chill experience. Standing on the felucca was awkward so we lay upon the big mattress and just meandered down the river, moving slowly with the wind. It was extremely relaxing and quiet, which is not often the case in Egypt. One of the felucca workers lit a huge hasish spliff and passed it around the boat, now this is the life.\nThat evening we moored at a grassy area with other boats. Workers from the cruise ships and sail-boats were playing soccer, which we joined in for a bit. Sleeping on the felucca wasn’t the best. Diesel generators from passing cruise ships were quite loud, mosquitos were relentless and the temperature was too hot at the beginning of the night, then too cold in the early morning. We all woke up tired.\nThe following day we sailed until Kom Ombo temple. The wind had dropped and we couldn’t go any further, or return. We ventured around the temple and returned to the felucca for lunch. We tried to get an understanding when we could return to Aswan city, but the felucca driver’s most knowledgable respose was “Inshallah” meaning “God willing”, so…sometime within the next week I guess. Obviously, us being spoilt Westerners, we needed more certainty about a return time, so we decided to take a train back to Aswan after lunch.\nOne night on a felucca was enough, I was looking forward to using my legs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca let the relaxation begin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca raise the sails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca water shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca water shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca downstream kids swimming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca water shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca water shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca luxury felucca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca mooring for the evening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca soccer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca donkey man\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca sunrise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca artsy shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca tree shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca Kom Ombo Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca Kom Ombo Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca Kom Ombo Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca Kom Ombo Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelucca goodbye crew\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\nFood poisoning\nThe day after returning from the felucca I was vomiting and had diarrhea from suspected food poisoning, maybe also from swimming in the Nile, although I never put my head under. Anyway, I was drained and spent a second full day in bed. This was a real shame because Trav and Nikita visited Abu Simbel.\n\n\n\nTombs of the Nobles / Hike\nThere is a walk on the west side of the Nile that has been beckoning us since we got here. In the morning Trav & I got the public ferry to the Tombs of the Nobles which we explored for a bit then walked through the desert for an hour or so to a small village, exploring monuments, such as the Dome of Abu Al-Hawa, along the way. The village is perched beneath the Aga Khan Mausoleum which is a beautiful structure but sadly has been shut for the last twenty-five years, not sure why.\nAt the village, DJs were setting up a stage and playing loud desert psytrance, some kind of celebration was happening. It started to kick off so we went over for a geez. A lot of young locals were gathered around the stage in a horseshoe shape, dancing, clapping hands and singing. The woman was making that “YeYeYeYeYe” desert sound. Fuck, this is nuts! We found out that the nursing students of Aswan have just graduated and this is their grad party.\nTrav and I joined in for a bit, dancing with locals to the beat of the drum, then we skipped off taking a rowboat to Elephantine Island. It was insanely hot so we went for a swim, afterwards making our way back to the hostel. That evening it was possible to hear the nursing students still celebrating across the Nile, most likely sober albeit.\nWhile in Aswan it would be sacrilege not to see Abu Simbel, so I booked minivan transportation leaving from the hostel at 4am the next morning. Abu Simbel is three hours away by car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs tomb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs pup with a view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs Trav powering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs golden sands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs donkey & camel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs nursing students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs nursing students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs nursing students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs nursing students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs nursing students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Tombs nursing students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRowboat to Elephantine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRowboat to Elephantine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRowboat to Elephantine stop for phone call\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElephantine Island swimming spot\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbu Simbel\nAbu Simbel is the site of two massive rock-cut temples.

This is not a good way to start the day! Exhausted, I slept the whole way to Abu Simbel.\nThe monument is mind-blowing! Twenty-metre statues originally carved into the cliff face (but relocated due to rising waters from the dam construction in the 60s) stand towering over everything else in the area. It would have been a sight to behold in ancient times, and it still is.\nI was feeling like shit, so a fellow Aussie lass (Beth) gave me a super strong panadol which knocked me out.

The Nile views here are beautiful and we stayed in a really social hostel where we met lots of cool people. I found the constant push from touts in Aswan a bit insistent. Even walking in and out of the hostel, you’re swamped by children smashing you with the same questions “What’s your name?”, and “Where you from?” and then asking for money. It’s the same routine shop owners and taxi, horse & felucca drivers hit you with when walking the Corniche (Nile foreshore), although theirs has developed around an area of business.\nMaybe the constant in-your-face nature of Egypt is wearing me down? - I wonder if Luxor will be different?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNile view from hostel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop down shot from hostel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarcy (left), Mi Shoo (right)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunset from hostel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunset from hostel\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Visiting an Oasis was always part of our schedule, we hadn’t decided which Oasis to visit prior to arriving in Egypt and planned on organising it while in the thick of things. There are five Oases in Egypt, each one offering a unique set of desert sights & experience.\nAfter researching transportation for an evening, visiting an Oasis wasn’t as simple as we anticipated. There didn’t seem to be any (non-tour) buses that ventured from the Nile roads travelling inland towards the desert. We spoke to employees at our hostel about options getting to the desert and found out our hostel actually offered a tour to the Bahariya Oasis for $90USD per person. This price included transportation to Bahariya, a jeep journey through the Black & White Deserts, one night camping in the White Desert, food and water for the entire tour and transportation back to Cairo. This was a pretty good deal. It relaxed the requirement for us to organise further components beyond transportation and the price wasn’t ludicrous. So we snapped this up, and got ready for the mini-bus which left at 6.30am the following morning, packing a small day bag for the trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mini-bus to Bahariya took around five hours, picking up tourists from other hostels & hotels along the way. Having other tourists on the tour was great because it gave us an opportunity to meet & talk to other people who came from all over the world. Joining us were Greeks, Chinese, Koreans, Turkish & Taiwanese.\nAfter arriving at the small village of Bawiti, we ate lunch and were split into two groups of six and assigned to a jeep driver who would chauffeur us around the Black & White Deserts. Our driver’s name was Hazim.\n\nBlack Desert\nThe Black Desert is an old volcanic area. Due to the volcanic activity, I was half expecting the sands to be black, much like the iron sands on Taranaki beaches. But the sand is not black, instead, mounds of black stone (not sure type of stone) push up through the sand forming small volcanoes everywhere, it looks like a scene straight out of Hades. The formations were quite beautiful and interesting. Driving fast through the desert in a trusty jeep, with Arabic music blasting really accentuated the feeling of adventure!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert Bahariya Oasis sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert interesting rock formation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert view from jeep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert on a dark desert highway...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert highway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert highway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert Trav & Hee (Korean)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Desert pit stop\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert\nLiterally across the highway from the Black Desert is the White Desert. The White Desert is whiter than the Black Desert is black. Here large limestone rocks are scattered everywhere, and we were weaving in between the rocks, driving down steep hills and drifting everywhere. I found views in the White Desert to be even more stunning and beautiful than the Black Desert. Hazim drove us to the top of a large sand dune and waxed up some sand-boards for us which we sat on and slid to the bottom of the dune. Trav & I asked about riding the boards standing up, but Hazim wasn’t keen on the idea because he has seen people injured in the past, and being injured in the desert with no medical assistance nearby is not a nice way to spend the evening. Trav actually attempted riding standing up, but the boards have no edge so carving down the slope wasn’t possible. Trav agreed that it was sketchy and a recipe for injury. After sand boarding we drove to a nice vantage point to watch the sunset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert limestone rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert jeeps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert roundish rocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert Trav\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert Me :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert swirling clouds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert big rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert view from jeep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert view from jeep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert sand boarding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert mushroom rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert white plains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert jeeps driving through round mounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert mound rock panoramic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert mountain vista\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert Hazem & jeep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert jeep derivers congregating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert chicken rock & sunset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert sunset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert view after sunset\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert - Overnight\nOnce the sun had set we drove to our camp where we would spend the night. The moon and stars early in the night were absolutely stunning, the Milky Way wasn’t visible yet. Hazim set up blankets for us to sit around around the fire and watch him prepare chicken, rice and pita bread for dinner. Dinner was delicious. By this time it was getting dark and the temperature dropped quickly. It was cold! Really cold! I was extremely glad to have packed a jacket. Not long after dinner Hazim set up a shisha pipe and we sat around the fire puffing shisha, just embracing the magical view of the Milky Way deep within the desert uninterrupted by light pollution and entombed within silence. This is a stark contrast to loud Cairo which we have been a part of for the last few days.\nWe opted to sleep under the stars instead of the tent, so we set up a thin mattress with sleeping bag and thick camel-fur blanket on the sand. The camel-fur blanket was an absolute necessity, it was insanely cold, and the blanket helped to establish a nice warm vacuum snug between the icy air and cool desert sand. With your head poking out the top a beanie would’ve achieved the comfort levels required to sleep, but I didn’t even bring one to Egypt, so Trav lent me a t-shirt which I wrapped around my head and went to sleep. I woke a few times in the night due to the cold and adjusted my camel-fur blanket to stave it off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert moon view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert fire moon view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert Hazim in main tent\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Desert - Sunrise\nWe woke at 6:30am to watch the sunrise.

By this time we had made new friends and got along with everyone on the tour really well. On the way home (to Cairo), we all exchanged WhatsApp numbers and prepared to swap and send photos with each other when we get back into WiFi range.\nIf I had the opportunity to do a jeep desert tour again I would organise more than one night.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cairo was the first stop on this seven month endeavour. After landing, Trav & I negotiated a taxi from the airport to our accommodation for a reasonable price of £300EGP ($15NZD). The initial taxi ride was a shock to the senses, noises & sights were overwhelming. Car horns, in particular, dominate airwaves, and beeps and bops blend into one continuous stream of alerts. The architecture of buildings and infrastructure that whiz past the window is curved and majestic, very different and foreign to the squared, angled buildings in Australasia. In contrast, half-finished apartment blocks lie adjacent drenched in rubble and construction waste. We have only been in Egypt for 30 minutes so far…a slight fear of integration gripped my mind on the initial taxi ride.\nWe spent five incredible days in Cairo and our time was distributed across a few themes, they were:\nBefore delving into each theme, I would like to describe the general atmosphere. Cairo has a population of 20 million, it is an extremely busy place this is what adds to its wondrous nature! The traffic is crazy, and merely crossing the road is a challenge, something that takes time to grasp. Our first attempt at crossing the road took minutes, we were waiting for a gap in the traffic to allow safe passage across the street although the gap never came. Locals seem to just drip into the traffic like flour moving through a cake-sifter, somehow emerging safely on the other side. After a few days, we seemed to get the hang of it, although not at the same level of confidence as the locals. The trick is to spot a section of traffic with no motorcycles (they’re nimble and unpredictable), raise your hand, step onto the road, make eye contact with drivers and feign a resolute air. Under no circumstances should you hesitate, stride with the perceived confidence of a fashion model on the runway. The fastest, loudest and most dangerous runway you’ve ever walked.\nTouts and salesmen approach you consistently. We must have looked the brightest shade of green when we first arrived because we were pulled into gift stores so many times. They’re all full of junk nik-naks such as plastic pyramid figures, unauthentic papyrus paper & perfume and shisha pipes. Everyone who approaches you on the street is an artist willing to show you their life’s work, and sell for a “good” price. Tour guide salespeople working for a “government-run” tourist agency try to vie a way into your schedule by approaching with “Where you from? - NZ, ahh, Kia Ora! <Insert proceeding sales pitch…>”. We found it more pleasant to organise tours directly through the hostel or hotel. Another common scam we were stung by a few times is the water scam. Sometimes when ordering food or coffee, the server will place a bottle of water on your table. Being ignorant Westerners we assumed this water was gratis, on the house, however when paying, the bottle of water gets added to the tab at an insanely exorbitant price. Whenever an extra service is included in your order but not initially discussed it becomes an entrepreneurial way for a few extra bucks to be squeezed from tourists. Everything is an add-on in Egypt, we learnt to say “no, thank you” when something additional makes its way into service. We also learnt to just ignore and walk away from insistent touts pushing you to empty your pockets one way or another. It becomes easy to identify when someone approaches with the aim to scam you.\nScams aside, people are friendly, and welcoming and just want to talk. Only once we felt unwanted and unsafe which happened to be in a backstreet neighbourhood. In saying that, our most genuine experiences were also experienced in backstreet neighbourhoods, so it’s a dicey situation when venturing from the beaten path, mainly geared toward positive experiences."

A conscious display of project scope alteration in history’s finest. Brilliant! Because of this miscalculation another pyramid was constructed nearby, the Red Pyramid. I’m unsure why the original project wasn’t abandoned and resources salvaged to build the replacement pyramid.\nWe were able to enter the pyramids here, which was exciting! Clambering down the steep entranceways into the pyramids felt like we were discovering something for the first time. It was a special feeling.

    "text": "Arriving back in Cairo from Bahariya our next destination planned was Aswan, Egypt’s southern most city. However, Trav & I counted up how many days remained on our visas and re-estimated how many nights to stay at destinations lined up (which was around 3/4 nights each), and it came out that we had about five days spare on our 30 day visas. Because of this, we changed tact a bit and decided to journey to Alexandria, Egypt’s second largest & northern most city situated on the Mediterranean coast. We had originally planned on skipping Alexandria all together. The following morning we went to the tourist intercity bus station (GoBus) and purchased tickets to Alexandria, leaving Cairo at 1.30pm, for £100EGP each ($5NZD).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bus ride was scheduled to be three hours, but traffic leaving Cairo was nuts so it took more like five. That morning Trav had woken up not feeling healthy and sniffled the whole bus ride. We arrived in Alexandria and caught a taxi to our accommodation (Clement’s Hotel), on the way I realised I had accidentally left my mobile phone on the bus. I was listening to music resting it between my legs, when we arrived I stood up, walked off the bus, leaving my phone on the seat. FUCK! - That’s annoying. We had an early night sleep because we were still a bit tired from the desert and Trav wasn’t feeling well.\nThe following day Trav was not in a good state, he decided to spend the day resting in bed. I lined up a few sights for myself, they were:\n\nSidi Morsi Abu Al-Abbas Mosque\nThe Fish Market\nCitadel Qaitbey Fort\nCheck if my phone had been found at the Bus Station\n\n\nSidi Morsi Abu Al-Abbas Mosque\nThe mosque is huge and split into three different buildings all opening up into one courtyard. I’m unsure if that means the buildings are literally different mosques, or they all belong to one. Regardless, the architecture was beautiful. I arrived around midday the same time as the early afternoon call to prayer, which was special because the prayer halls were full, people were lined up in the courtyard with mats and prayers crackled loudly from the distorted speakers. It was an amazing sight to behold, and lasted for about fifteen minutes. I really wanted to snap a few photos but felt it would be disrespectful, so refrained from doing so.\nOne thing I realised moving on from this mosque is that, in general, streets surrounding mosques is where life happens. The mosques act as a congregation point for locals to buy & sell goods and negotiate trades & services. The street atmosphere after this particular call to prayer was really alive and fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque like the colour scheme on this building\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Abbas Mosque\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish Market\nAlexandria is on the coast and is built upon a culture of the ocean. An elderly gentlemen I had coffee with this morning (we spoke via sign-language), was a retired fisherman. His walking stick was an old fishing rod. So while here, I must check out and try the fresh fish. On Google Maps two Fish Markets could be pin-pointed, I made note to check them both out. After arriving at the first one, I realised it was actually a restaurant called “Fish Market”, now that’s a deceiving name. It looked like a flash joint, I highly doubt they charged market rates. A bit disappointing, although there is another one just up the road…or, so I thought.\nThe next fish market supposedly lined the entry to Qaitbay Fort. Sadly, this was just a normal market dotted with touts selling regular, uninteresting plastic trinkets. Bummer! Luckily after my time at Qaitbay Fort I stumbled across fresh fish being cooked and sold on the street. I bought a small red fish (no idea what kind) and two prawns, which were cooked in front of me. I was charged £160EGP for this! I’m unsure if this is the going rate for fresh food or I got totally ripped off, I think the latter. Regardless, the fresh fish & prawns cooked in spices was delicious!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish Market fresh seafood for sale, ready to be cooked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish Market fresh seafood for sale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish Market unsurprisingly, lots of cats here\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitadel Qaitbey Fort\nOn the peninsula a citadel call Qaitbay Fort was built in the 1470’s. Aside from the ocean & city views visible from the fort, there wasn’t much interesting about this place. I think I was a bit put off with all the scam artists hanging around. It was hard to have a moment of peace while being constantly bombarded by people asking if I want a photo (most probably from a stolen camera), or to buy something. Two young men followed me around the fort eventually approaching me to ask if they could hang out and practice English, I had absolutely zero trust in the fact that was what they actually wanted to do. I pretended to take a photo of something and walked away. I left Qaitbay Fort slightly agitated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort promenade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view over bay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view over bay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view within citadel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view from within\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort view over bay into ocean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort Citadel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort Citadel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort Citadel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort obligatory cat photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQaitbay Fort gardens at entry\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoBus Phone Reclamation Attempt\nI was a bit gutted having lost my phone, so I thought returning to the bus station to check if it had been handed in could be a good idea. I flagged down a taxi and tried to explain to the driver where I wanted to go. He understood the word “bus” and started driving in the complete wrong direction, eventually arriving back at Qaitbay Fort, pointing at buses and repeating the word “bus” on the way. This was going nowhere. I was already agitated from Qaitbay Fort so I just got out of the car and made my way back to the Hotel on foot.\nI managed to contact GoBus via WhatsApp on my laptop, they told me no lost property had been handed in from my bus trip. So it is now certain, my phone is gone. Luckily it was a cheap, cracked OPPO that I’ve already had for four years. Bloody annoying though!\n\n\nThe Next Day - My Birthday\nIt is my 32nd birthday today, what an awesome place to be on my birthday! Trav is feeling slightly better so will join me in doing:\n\nThe Roman Theatre\nThe Catacombs\nBuying a train ticket to Aswan on the sleeper train\nBirthday Beersies\n\nBefore venturing out for the day we had a quick video call with Mum & Dad, it was great catching up with them.\n\n\nThe Roman Theatre\nThe Roman Theatre shows a slice of life in 200AD.

I guess the Catacombs were established at a point in time when these three cultures intersected at the same place, Alexandria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatacombs Trav in front of colourful tombs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatacombs colourful tombs probably for important people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatacombs interesting blend of cultures in markings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatacombs interesting blend of cultures in markings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatacombs interesting blend of cultures in markings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatacombs unnamed graves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatacombs unnaed graves\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAswan Sleeper Train\nNow this was an absolute debacle! We spent nearly an hour at the station just trying to find the sleeper train ticket office. No-one could give us accurate directions, eventually we asked a pharmacist at the train station pharmacy (pro-tip Egyptian pharmacists speak really good English). We eventually found the ticket office. To our surprise purchasing one ticket required $80USD cash, Egyptian pounds and credit card were not accepted. What the actual flying fuck!? - Why would Egyptian pounds not be accepted in Egypt? So we decided to exchange some cash the following day and return in the morning.\n\n\nBirthday Beersies\nWe went out for beers that evening to celebrate my birthday. Drinking in Egypt feels like a sin, the bars (if they can be found) have tinted windows and are dark and seedy inside. We smashed back a few beers and got a burger on the way home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirthday Spitfire Bar closest thing to a Kiwi flag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirthday Spitfire Bar Vaporwave David\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAswan Sleeper Train - cont\nWe set aside a couple hours to sort this out, checking out of our hotel just in case it took a while. Boy-oh-boy, the saga continued! Our first stop was the bank to exchange cash, at the bank we were told no banks in Egypt exchange cash, the only place to do so is at street cash-exchanges. We then ventured to the financial area of town where banks and cash-exchanges are clustered. The first cash exchange only had $140USD, we required $160USD, so we took $100USD and went to the next exchange. There we were told foreigners can only buy foreign (non-Egyptian) currency if they present their plane ticket. We thought that was kinda weird. This was a reoccurring theme at every exchange we went to. They were either out of USD or wouldn’t sell to us because we couldn’t show a plane ticket.\nUnsuccessful, we felt defeated and went back to the hotel to reevaluate. Our next best option was to get a bus back to Cairo and attempt to purchase a sleeper train ticket from there. This part of the saga went quite smoothly. We swooped in on a GoBus with minutes to spare, arrived at Cairo train station and purchased a sleeper ticket using credit card and hung out at the station playing cards for a bit. Tomorrow we will wake up in Aswan to begin the next chapter of our travels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView from coffee shop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeshore Hotel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeshore Apartments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSheep & Rams outside mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc Monuments\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"

    "text": "We arrived at Antalya airport and were on the tram to our hostel by six in the morning. Amazingly, a tram runs from the airport to the city at, seemingly, all hours of the day. After weaving our way through the old-town cobblestone streets on foot, we found an employee sleeping on the couch at the hostel. He awoke, and mumbled sleepily that check-in wasn’t until one in the afternoon, “We got nowhere to go, bro!”, was our response. He invited us into the worker’s quarters, and all three of us slept on the couch together. We booked three nights in Antalya and hadn’t necessarily planned to do any activities, although we ended up visiting two different waterfalls and swimming in the ocean. The main bulk of time here was spent planning our upcoming five-day hike in the Lucian Way and socialising with others at the hostel bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Hiking Equipment\nIt was clear my day bag was too small, it was large enough for a drink bottle, scarf and camera. Barley had enough room to pick up supplies when we were out and about. So a new day bag for me made it to the list of things to purchase. Also on the list were: hiking socks, stove gas, a camping mattress, and a tent that Trav will buy.\nWe found a hiking store about thirty minutes walk from the hostel and managed to source all items there for a reasonable price (20% discount). Trav bought a two-man MSR tent weighing less than one kilogram for around $1000NZD, which is expensive, but a lifetime purchase and will be amazing on the hike. I also found a thirty-litre day pack, boasting many pockets, nooks & crannies and extreme comfort. It was an awesome purchase and made day trips much more manageable.\n\n\nDuden Waterfall & Beach\nAfter purchasing supplies from the hiking store, we caught a bus to Duden Waterfall. The public transport system in Antalya has been great so far, we’ve managed to use either tram or bus to get to most places, and a single trip costs ₺10TL ($0.8NZD). Duden Waterfall is a fast-flowing stream that gushes into the Mediterranean Ocean. It’s situated relatively inner-city and is a bit of a hangout point for young families.\nAfter snapping a few photos, we walked forty minutes or so to the swimming beach. Even though the weather was cold and windy, Trav was eager to take his first dip in the Mediterranean, so we took a satisfying cold plunge and caught the bus home for a few drinks with others at the hostel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuden Waterfall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuden Waterfall looking into Mediterranean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuden Waterfall mountain coastline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuden Waterfall cat with a view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuden Waterfall stream\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurşunlu Waterfall\nThe following day we took a bus to Kurşunlu Waterfall Reserve. This area had an entrance fee, but it was a reasonable price, I can’t remember how much exactly. Inside the reserve is a short circuit walk consisting of a few picturesque waterfalls and a lovely cafe at the end where we drank cay (Turkish tea). These weren’t the waterfalls we actually intended to be at. People at the hostel described some free waterfalls (named Uçansu Falls) that required a small hike to arrive at, somehow we ended up at Kurşunlu Waterfall but it was still a nice day.\nWe attempted to climb a fence and do some of our own hiking along the riverside, but many restaurant employees were working in the fields and we felt awkward jumping the fence to their compound. Instead, we ventured outside in the suburban streets for a short period.\nThat evening, we found a Palestinian guy (Bara) who was keen to join us on the Lycian way. So we have a hiking companion!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurşunlu Waterfall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurşunlu Waterfall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurşunlu Waterfall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurşunlu Waterfall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurşunlu Waterfall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurşunlu Waterfall duck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenture outside Kurşunlu Waterfall playground\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenture outside Kurşunlu Waterfall local mosque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenture outside Kurşunlu Waterfall children playing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenture outside Kurşunlu Waterfall dog napping\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrap Up\nFor our next destination, we lined up a small side trip to Pamukkale to visit the travertine flats (travertine is calcium like substance) followed by two nights in Göreme (Capadocia) to witness the hot air balloons and do some hiking. This trip was in the complete opposite direction to our initial plan, so we packed enough clothes, necessary electronics and hygiene items into our day packs (my new 30-litre bag!!!), and stored our large backpacks at the hostel in Antalya for four nights. After this short stint, we’ll come back to Antalya, pick up our bags and make our way to Kaş to meet Bara and begin hiking the Lucian way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntalya port view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntalya port view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptian Jack Sparrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe-aware of good kitties\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"
