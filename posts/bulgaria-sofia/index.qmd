Travelling by night bus is never fun, the upside of it is a night of accommodation and transportation are paid together. Slinking back to the hostel in Antalya in the early morning, we re-packed our backpacks and stocked up on a few supplies like vape juice and cash monies. It was no hassle catching a Kaş bus, they departed every forty-five minutes, and upon arriving at the bus terminal, we were instantly ushered onto the next awaiting bus - "Yalah, yalah, yalah" (let's go).

```{r}
destinations <- list(
  "Istanbul" = list(label="Istanbul", transport=NA, label_pos="right"),
  "Sofia" = list(label="Sofia", transport="car", label_pos="top")
)

m <- plot_hybrid_route_flex(
  names(destinations),
  how = na.omit(map_chr(destinations, "transport")),
  label_text = as.vector(map_chr(destinations, "label")),
  label_position = as.vector(map_chr(destinations, "label_pos")),
  weight=3,
  colour="blue",
) |> 
  leaflet::addScaleBar(position = "bottomleft")

m$x$options$zoomControl <- TRUE
m
